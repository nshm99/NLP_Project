around bc, served the roman army under caesar and specialized the design and construction artillery machines. his duties took him what are now spain and france and far away north africa. vitruvius later became architect and worked temple, longer existence, the town fano italy. his most important work was literary, the only surviving book architecture from classical antiquity: architectura, known today the ten books architecture.', 'for many dark centuries, vitruvius’s work had been forgotten, but the early 1400s was one the many pieces classical writing, including lucretius’s epic poem the nature things and cicero’s orations, that were rediscovered and collected the pioneering italian humanist poggio bracciolini. monastery switzerland, poggio found eighth-century copy vitruvius’s opus, and sent back florence. there became part the firmament rediscovered classical works that birthed the renaissance. brunelleschi used reference when traveled rome young man measure and study the ruins classical buildings, and alberti quoted extensively his treatise architecture. latin edition was published the late 1480s one italy’s new print shops, and leonardo wrote notebook, “enquire the stationers about vitruvius.”', 'what made vitruvius’s work appealing leonardo was that gave concrete expression analogy that went back plato and the ancients, one that had become defining metaphor renaissance humanism: the relationship between the microcosm man and the macrocosm the earth.', 'leonardo embraced the analogy both his art and his science. famously wrote around this time, “the ancients called man lesser world, and certainly the use this name well bestowed, because his body analog for the world.”', 'applying this analogy the design temples, vitruvius decreed that the layout should reflect the proportions human body, the body were laid out flat its back upon the geometric forms the floor plan. “the design temple depends symmetry,” wrote the outset his third book. “there must precise relation between its components, the case those well-shaped man.”', 'vitruvius described great detail the proportions this “well-shaped man” that should inform the design temple. the distance from his chin the top his forehead should one-tenth his whole height, began, and proceeded with many other such notations. “the length the foot one sixth the height the body; the forearm, one fourth; and the breadth the breast also one fourth. the other members, too, have their own symmetrical proportions, and was employing them that the famous painters and sculptors antiquity attained great and endless renown.”', 'vitruvius’s descriptions human proportions would inspire leonardo, part the anatomy studies had just begun 1489, compile similar set measurements. more broadly, vitruvius’s belief that the proportions man are analogous those well-conceived temple and the macrocosm the world became central leonardo’s worldview.', 'after detailing human proportions, vitruvius went describe, memorable visualization, way put man circle and square order determine the ideal proportion church:', 'in temple there ought harmony the symmetrical relations the different parts the whole. the human body, the central point the navel. man placed flat his back, with his hands and feet extended, and compass centered his navel, his fingers and toes will touch the circumference circle thereby described. and just the human body yields circular outline, too square may found from it. for measure the distance from the soles the feet the top the head, and then apply that measure the outstretched arms, the breadth will found the same the height, the case perfect square.', 'it was powerful image. but far know, one note had made serious and precise drawing along these lines the fifteen centuries since vitruvius composed his description. then, around 1490, leonardo and his friends proceeded tackle this depiction man spread-eagle amid church and the universe.', 'francesco giorgio produced least three such drawings that were designed accompany his treatise and translation vitruvius. one them shows sweet and dreamy image man circle and square. suggestive rather than precise drawing. the circle, square, and body not attempt show proportions and are instead rendered casually. two other drawings that francesco made depict man more carefully proportioned inside design circles and squares the shape church floor plan.', 'around the same time, another dear friend leonardo produced drawing based vitruvius’s passage. giacomo andrea was part the collaborative circle architects and engineers gathered ludovico the court milan. luca pacioli, mathematician the court and another close friend leonardo, wrote dedication edition his book divine proportion that listed the distinguished members that court. after hailing leonardo, pacioli adds, “there was also giacomo andrea ferrara, dear leonardo brother, keen student vitruvius’s works.”', 'andrea produced simple version spread-armed man circle and square. notably, the circle and square are not centered; the circle rises higher than the square, which allows the man’s navel the center the circle and his genitals the center the square, like vitruvius had suggested. the man’s arms are stretched outward, christ-like, and his feet are close together.', 'andrea would end being killed and brutally quartered french troops when they captured milan nine years later. shortly thereafter, leonardo would search for and find his manuscript copy vitruvius’s work. “messer vincenzio aliprando, who lives near the inn the bear, has giacomo andrea’s vitruvius,” declared notebook entry.', 'in the 1980s, andrea’s drawing was rediscovered. architectural historian claudio sgarbi found heavily illustrated manuscript copy vitruvius’s tome that was languishing archive ferrara, italy. determined that manuscript had been compiled andrea. among its 127 illustrations was andrea’s version vitruvian man.', 'there are two key differences that distinguish leonardo’s version vitruvian man from those done around the same time his two friends, francesco giorgio and giacomo andrea. both scientific precision and artistic distinction, leonardo’s entirely different realm.', 'rarely display, because prolonged exposure light would cause fade, kept locked room the fourth floor the gallerie dell’accademia venice. when curator brought out and placed before table, was struck the indentations made the stylus leonardo’s metalpoint pen and the twelve pricks made the point his compass. had the eerie and intimate sensation seeing the hand the master work more than five centuries earlier.', 'unlike those his friends, leonardo’s drawing meticulously done. his lines are not sketchy and tentative. instead, dug hard with his stylus, carving the lines confidently into the page were making etching. had planned this drawing very carefully and knew precisely what was doing.', 'before began, had determined exactly how the circle would rest the base the square but extend out higher and wider. using compass and set square, drew the circle and the square, then allowed the man’s feet rest comfortably them. result, per vitruvius’s description, the man’s navel the precise center the circle, and his genitals are the center the square.', 'in one the notes below the drawing, leonardo described additional aspects the positioning: “if you open your legs enough that your head lowered one-fourteenth your height and raise your hands enough that your extended fingers touch the line the top your head, know that the center the extended limbs will the navel, and the space between the legs will equilateral triangle.”', 'other notes the page provide more detailed measurements and proportions, which attributed vitruvius:', 'vitruvius, architect, writes his work architecture that the measurements man are distributed this manner:', 'the length the outspread arms equal the height man.', 'from the hairline the bottom the chin one-tenth the height man.', 'from below the chin the top the head one-eighth the height man.', 'from above the chest the top the head one-sixth the height

the elbow the tip the hand quarter the height man.', 'from the elbow the armpit one-eighth the height man.', 'the length the hand one-tenth the height man.', 'the root the penis [il membro virile] half the height man.', 'the foot one-seventh the height man.', 'despite what stated, instead accepting what vitruvius had written, leonardo relied his own experience and experiments, per his creed. fewer than half the twenty-two measurements that leonardo cited are the ones vitruvius handed down. the rest reflect the studies anatomy and human proportion that leonardo had begun recording his notebooks. for example, vitruvius puts the height man six times the length his foot, but leonardo records seven times.', 'in order make his drawing informative work science, leonardo could have used simplified figure man. instead, used delicate lines and careful shading create body remarkable and unnecessary beauty. with its intense but intimate stare and the curls hair that leonardo loved draw, his masterpiece weaves together the human and the divine.', 'the man seems motion, vibrant and energetic, just like the four-winged dragonflies that leonardo studied. leonardo has made sense, almost see, one leg and then the other being pushed out and pulled back, the arms flapping flight. there nothing static except the calm torso, with subtle crosshatch shadings behind it. yet despite the sense motion, there natural and comfortable feel the man. the only slightly awkward positioning his left foot, which twisted outward provide measurement guide.', 'to what extent might vitruvian man self-portrait? leonardo was thirty-eight when drew it, about the age the man the picture. contemporary descriptions emphasize his “beautiful curling hair” and “well-proportioned” body. vitruvian man echoes features seen many assumed portraits him, especially bramante’s depiction heraclitus, which shows leonardo still beardless about that age. leonardo once warned against falling prey the axiom “every painter paints himself,” but section his proposed treatise painting called “how figures often resemble their masters,” accepted that was natural so.', 'the stare vitruvian man intense someone looking mirror, perhaps literally. according toby lester, who wrote book about the drawing, “it’s idealized self-portrait which leonardo, stripped down his essence, takes his own measure, and doing embodies timeless human hope: that just might have the power mind figure out how fit into the grand scheme things. think the picture act speculation, kind metaphysical self-portrait which leonardo artist, natural philosopher, and stand-in for all humanity peers himself with furrowed brow and tries grasp the secrets his own nature.”', 'leonardo’s vitruvian man embodies moment when art and science combined allow mortal minds probe timeless questions about who are and how fit into the grand order the universe. also symbolizes ideal humanism that celebrates the dignity, value, and rational agency humans individuals. inside the square and the circle can see the essence leonardo vinci, and the essence ourselves, standing naked the intersection the earthly and the cosmic.']"

visualizations.', 'nate’s forecasting prowess has become accepted canon the popular media. routine guest many nationally televised shows discuss his predictions during every national election cycle. came quite shock when nassim taleb, best-selling author, and quantitative risk expert, publicly announced that fivethirtyeight does not know how forecast elections properly!', 'for his part, taleb has become extremely successful due his shrewd understanding probability the real world. his books are both philosophical and technical, with focus uncertainty and risk. specifically, believes that the vast majority quantitative models used practice not sufficiently account for real-world risk. instead, they give the illusion short-term value (like being accurate some well-understood situations) but

present our work reliable and verifiable way. you must decide for yourself taleb has point just another crazy rich person with too much time his hands.', 'the primary source controversy and confusion surrounding fivethirtyeight’s predictions that they are ‘probabilistic.’ practically what this means that they not predict winner loser but instead report likelihood. further complicating the issue,

artificially increasing variance based the time until event similar adjustments). this creates infinitely recursive debate whose model the ‘best’ most like the real world. course, judge this, you could look who performed better the long run. this where things off the rails bit.', 'because fivethirtyeight only predicts probabilities, they not ever take absolute stand outcome: ‘skin the game’ taleb would say. this not, however, something their readers follow suit on. the public eye, they (fivethirtyeight) are judged how many events with forecasted probabilities above and below 50% happened didn’t respectively (in binary setting). or, they (the readers) just pick the highest reported probability the intended forecast. for example, they were showered with accolades when after, ‘calling states the 2008 presidential race correctly’ nate silver was placed times 100 most influential people list. should not have accepted the honor didn’t call winner any the states!', 'the public can excused for using the 50% rule without asking. for example, supervised machine learning, classification model must have characteristic called ‘decision boundary.’ this often decided priori and

probabilistic argument may valid, but can cause some angst seems disingenuous. even the washington post had opinion piece which opined much during the 2016 election.', 'what not clear that there factor hidden from the fivethirtyeight reader. predictions have two types uncertainty; aleatory and epistemic. aleatory uncertainty concerned with the fundamental system (probability rolling six

outcome; like election!', 'bespoke models, like fivethirtyeight’s, only report the public aleatory uncertainty concerns their statistical outputs (inference monte carlo this case). the trouble that epistemic uncertainty very difficult (sometimes impossible) estimate. for example, why didn’t fivethirtyeight’s model incorporate, before happened, chance that comey would re-open his investigation

ignored priori and then fivethirtyeight assumes wild fluctuations prediction from unforeseen events are normal part forecasting. which should lead ask ‘if the model ignoring some the most consequential uncertainties, are really getting reliable probability?’', 'to expand this further, have consolidated some fivethirtyeight’s predictions, using their open source data, for two very different types events; u.s. senate elections and national football leauge (nfl) games. here comparison the final forecast probability and the actual proportion outcomes.', 'the sports data (nfl games) has excellent linear relationship. these proportions are built using 30k data points, so, assume the system stable, have averaged out any sampling error. however, you can see, there still noticable variation 2–5% actual proportion predictions. this signal un-addressed epistemic uncertainty. also means you cannot take one these forecast probabilities face value.', 'sports, like other games chance, have very well defined mechanisms which lend themselves statistical analysis. the other hand, highly non-linear events, like contested elections, may not. with much fewer data points you can see the variation the senate predictions enormous. gauging the performance models these types events becomes doubly difficult. isn’t clear prediction wrong owing the quality the model (epistemic) just luck (aleatory).', 'one the most troubling things about this approach forecasting that opens pandora’s box for narrative fallacies. why did clinton lose? comey? email servers? people can then justify possibly spurious inferences eyeballing events which occur around the forecast variation. ‘just look how the forecast changing will all this news!’', think this what has taleb arms. the blog feels more like slick sales pitch, complete with quantitative buzzwords, than unbiased analysis (though may very well be). prediction does not obey some fundamental characteristics, should not marketed probability. more importantly, prediction should judged from the time given the public and not just the moment before the event. forecaster should held responsible for both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty.', 'when viewed this way, clear that fivethirtyeight reports too much noise leading event and not enough signal. this great for driving users read long series related articles the same topic but not rigorous bet your fortune on. taleb and silvers take how fivethirtyeight should judged can visualized like this.', 'because there much uncertainty around non-linear events, like election, could reasonably considered frivolous report early stage forecasts. the only conceivable reason capture (and monetize?) the interest public which hungry know the future. will not into the technical arguments, taleb has written and published paper the key issues with solution.', 'here can say, with some confidence that fivethirtyeight predictions are not always reliable probabilities. however, they masquerade one, being between and and all. this taleb’s primary argument; fivethirtyeight’s predictions not behave like probabilities that incorporate all uncertainty and should not passed off them.', not want suggest that fivethirtyeight bad their craft. they are, likely, the best poll aggregator the business. only look the last reported probabilistic forecast and use the public’s decision boundary, they are more successful than any other source attempting the same task. however, positioning yourself appear correct regardless the outcome, making users infer their own decision boundaries, over-reporting predictions, and ignoring epistemic uncertainty should not overlooked. how goes fivethirtyeight’s reputation, goes much the data community’s reputation.', 'be clear

domination outside nations. finally, syria overcomes the push and pull world events. out chaos comes the birth new and lasting order. it’s the last and most important coup.', 'so, who you think led that coup?', 'ten points you said: hafez al-assad. aka abu basil, father basil, bashar, and syria.', 'hafez al-assad made his first power moves after syria lost israel yet another failed war. the year was 1967. hafez al-assad was the minister defense for syria during the six days war. col. hafez al-assad mostly stayed out the struggles for power that resulted from the loss israel. course, hafez had opinions, but saw himself military man. the sort who takes orders. the minister defense, there were many the military who respected him. did many politicians. his opinions shaped syrian policy. which meant, also had political rivals. his key rival was the salah jadid, the president syria. after al-assad discovered assassination plot against him masterminded the sitting president, decided was time for him full gangster, and just take over the whole operation.', 'in november 1970, the government under president jadid convened emergency national congress. was called settle down the growing crisis confidence his leadership. feeling threatened his popular minister defense, president jadid was eager sideline hafez al-assad. his plan was use the emergency national congress very publicly remove al-assad from any and all official government posts holds. it’s common move when one fears coup from the military. all the top leadership syria attended the emergency national congress. but hafez al-assad rolled like gangster. one who had his own army. when arrived the emergency national congress, ordered his most loyal troops surround the building.', 'inside, the meeting goes down planned. president jadid stripped al-assad all his official government positions. thoroughly shamed, the president and his allies feel convinced this public embarrassment will effectively sideline the former minister defense. and they’re lucky, might salt the earth for any future political ambitions. how wrong were they? they totally failed realize who they were dealing with. hafez motherfucking al-assad.', 'once the emergency national congress was concluded, al-assad declares himself in-charge syria, and confidently orders his troops arrest president jadid and his key supporters, and anyone who opposes his new leadership. very un-democratic move, al-assad seized control the whole damn country. his loyal soldiers didn’t even have fire single shot.', 'after hafez al-assad’s bloodless coup was total success, everyone syria gets the message. and they get line. finally, there’s some order and stability. comes the form authoritarian leader. but there doubt hafez al-assad the undisputed leader syria, stabilizing force, and would remain for the next thirty years.', 'now, make things little more interesting, keep mind, the al-assad family are alawites. remember they’re the same tribal group that wouldn’t originally partner with the city-states aleppo and damascus way back when the newly-formed french-mandated nation syria was first negotiating its various independence deals with france after the end world war that’s how far back these tensions go. unresolved tensions from world war and the religious tension are far older than that. since al-assad member the shia minority group alawites, maintain his tight grip leadership, the supreme leader syria, often acted with crushing violence suppress any uprisings the sunni-predominant urban centers, such damascus and aleppo.', 'when you hear about people living syrian city such damascus, aleppo, homs, you might think they’re all the same. they’re all syrians. you have keep mind these are groups people from different historic ethnic groups. aleppo and damascus aren’t just cities syria. they were ancient, independent city-states. americans, might think them two neighboring cities like cleveland and cincinnati. but it’s more like cleveland and cincinnati were once fierce rivals, and then one day, some foreigners with guns and bombs came along, drew line around them all, called border, and said they now live ohio. this important but often overlooked aspect life syrian cities. the cities are ancient rivals.', 'right about now you may wondering, “but wait, where america this story? when does the u.s. show this tale?”', 'at the end world war ii––much like the end world war i––there were two new superpowers, only this time was america and the soviet union. the world entered its post-colonial period. all around the globe, new nations popped into existence. either through war and revolution, through mandate, sometimes through royal decree. but for three decades, nations constantly stepped free the grip their former colonial rulers. the countries emerged from european rule, the new nations often had pick, either, the u.s. the soviet union their strategic ally. return, the two competing superpowers used the new nations sites for their proxy wars. this how the middle east became patchwork soviet and u.s.-alliances.', 'never one miss trick, hafez al-assad exploited regional politics and cold war politics his benefit. with soviet weapons, al-assad turned syria into feared and respected arab republic. one that was worthy military rival its southern neighbor, israel. but that fight would have wait, because there was new threat spreading the middle east, one that pitted muslim against muslim. the militarized political arrangements the seventies and the hopes for peace the middle east, that seemed near hand after president carter, menachem begin, and anwar sadat struck peace accord between egypt and israel drew sudden and surprising close the end the decade. was like someone had turned all the lights the disco. the culprit was iran. iran turned the lights the disco. but that’s what you when your thing islamic fundamentalism.', 'the year was 1978, when theocratic movement students and religious clerics united overthrow the american-backed shah iran, every leader the middle east turned their head watch, wondering they could next, the ayatollah urged all muslims reject western powers and embrace islamic fundamentalism, adopt religious values the guiding voice for politics the region. that was direct challenge hafez al-assad, who was the secular socialist president partnered with the atheist soviet union, who was actively war against muslims afghanistan. not good look for arab leader when everyone’s talking theocracy. and you know al-assad will suppress the first signs rebellion revolt; detected the faintest whiff protest would met with state violence. because, never forget, al-assad alawite, which means shia muslim who’s the leader majority sunni nation. this what anyone would call crisis leadership. but hafez al-assad had seen coming. since 1976, he’d been putting down his own islamist uprising syria.', 'after four years him waging sectarian violence against the syrian sunni fundamentalists, backed the muslim brotherhood egypt, the revolts against al-assad metastasized into full-on assassination attempts. 1980, there was nearly successful attempt al-assad’s life that did succeed scaring him into responding with increasingly horrific violence. the embattled president put his brother charge counterinsurgency with one goal: crush the sunni islamist revolt.', 'in 1982, al-assad ordered the siege the city hama. for days, the syrian government pummeled the civilians the city with artillery attacks and waves aerial bombings. when they finally stopped, the syrian government had killed 20,000–40,000 thousand its own citizens. (the number fatalities depends whose count you use.) around the world, the hama massacre was widely-criticized, was shocking atrocity. but the revolt was put down. the hama massacre was one the most heinous acts arab government ever committed against its own people. does sound kinda familiar though?', 'now, let’s jump forward ten years.', 'it’s 1991. there’s war brewing the persian gulf. america led george bush the elder about take iraq the first gulf war.', 'can you guess who secular, socialist, soviet union-backed, president al-assad and his syrian government chose their ally the gulf war?', 'just like did the iran-iraq war 1980, hafez al-assad, leader the socialist ba’ath party syria, decides help foreign power fight and defeat the ba’ath party iraq. stuns the world and sides with western power, america, and aids its attacks majority muslim nation.', 'after the first gulf war ends, al-assad still power, and now he’s little less worried about fundamental muslim revolution deposing him. the americans are now the ones attract their fundamentalists’ anger and incur their violence. but he’s also still feeling bit unprotected. was about lose his biggest ally. that same year, december 1991, al-assad and the rest the world watched the soviet union dissolved like sugar cube the rain.', 'how could al-assad negotiate the new political reality and retain power syria? his options were limited. could become unofficial american ally, like egypt had done. but the risk there was that might turn him into puppet the eyes his people, and spell doom for his leadership like did for the shah iran. what about the muslim nation his north, turkey?', 'for many readers turkey’s role the middle east may something question mark. like, what’s the deal with turkey the middle east? are they part it, not? turkey exists the physical divide between europe and asia. it’s gateway nation, which makes it’s impossible country read. it’s nation with two faces. looks one way westerners. and quite different easterners, like iran russia. and, turkey looks quite different the arab world. the eyes their culture see further back history. arab eyes turkey conjures memories centuries domination the ottoman empire that only ended thanks the bloodshed world war and now, century later, memories turkish domination are not forgotten, forgiven. this day, arab nation wishes see the return dominant turkey. which means, syria, like all its other arab neighbors, will always avoid partnering with turkey.', 'so, who can socialist, religiously moderate, secular nation like syria partner with help them remain free and independent country? while also avoiding the ever-present threat hostile takeover the fundamentalist islamic wave that burns like coals all across the middle east, always ready flare and start new bonfire resistance?', 'to buy himself time, all throughout the nineties, al-assad plays diplomacy games with the west. makes overtures that much like egypt did, syria will make peace with israel. works high level political calculus,and all the while al-assad drags his feet through round after round international negotiations and discussions about the planned peace deal and new treaty with israel. president clinton and the west especially want al-assad’s help and stamp approval israel-palestine solution. america thinks there can one day peace the middle east. this idea al-assad dangles like bait before the west, but never formally confirms anything. plays the west.', 'just has done for decades his dealings with the west, al-assad employs stalling tactics his negotiations, and soon enough, finds has new ally. one that’s perfectly suited keep the west from strong-arming him, and protect him from losing power the islamist fundamentalist. his new ally was old friend.', 'from the ashes the soviet union, had emerged new nation, one weaker than before, but bound together ruthless form gangster-capitalism. they call the new nation the russian federation. thanks the fact they’re natural and historic allies, syria partnered with the new russia. this move kept regional powers like iran check. also kept the regional powers like saudi arabia and egypt, who are both majority sunni populations, along with the gulf states abu dhabi, qatar, and dubai, from dominating the region with the backing the americans. and remember, the americans are, for the most part, just update the former colonial powers, the british and the french. which, like the turks, arab nation wants their foreign ruler. plus, partnering with russia, makes arch-rivals israel, and turkey, think twice about ever messing with syria. the geopolitical chessboard it’s brilliant move make. it’s exactly what you expect from political gangster genius like hafez al-assad: wait for the world change.', 'over the last 100 years, since, roughly, 1920, syria has partnered with the french, the nazi-occupied french government, the british, the americans, the egyptians, the iranians, the soviets, and most recently, the russians. for hundred years, they’ve struggled free and independent nation that sets its own destiny. that, they’ve had play global politics. which means they’ve played the dark and dirty games the region, riding waves violence they ceaselessly ebbed and flowed, ever since the ottoman empire crumbled the end world war i.', 'as nation, syria began two dominant city-states, damascus and aleppo, grouped together with number various ethnic tribes, most notably, the two tribal states, the alawites the north, and the druze the south, all forced together foreign map-makers and their colonial bosses. the one man hold power syria, supreme leader hafez al-assad, from the alawite minority, strongman who always felt the only way for him hold onto power majority-sunni nation, with majority-sunni nations for neighbors, was periodically wage indescribable acts violence against the citizens his own nation. defeat outsiders chose kill syrians. this point, you could cynically call family tradition.', 'to understand why, 2017, president bashar al-assad gassed his own people, and has bombed the city aleppo into post-apocalyptic wasteland, you need look further than his father. that’s his blueprint.', 'first, the people living the city-state aleppo are not al-assad’s people. bashar may the leader syria, but his people, his father’s people, are the alawite tribe from the north. the people aleppo are sunnis. bashar, he’s killing enemies, not his people. the syrian revolution began 2011. one the first and largest anti-assad protests was the city hama. bashar responded with tanks. the time his men were done suppressing the protest, they’d killed two hundred civilians. was called the siege hama. which mirrors his father’s hama massacre. this just what the family does hold power.', 'secondly, president bashar al-assad and will always battling against the same fundamentalist muslims his dad had quash. one form another, they’re the same ones that have been trying overthrow the syrian government since the mid-seventies. that’s commitment. the muslim brotherhood and its allies would still love see fundamentalist sunni leadership syria. the iran revolutionary guard would also love see fundamentalist muslim leadership syria, only difference they’d prefer led shia muslims, not sunnis like the muslim brotherhood. and, course, there’s isis. each fundamental islamist group imagines differently, but they share the same general goal: religious revolution. bashar al-assad firmly believes the only thing holding back these various flavors muslim fundamentalism the constant reminder the pain death.', 'thirdly: there’s russia. vladimir putin enjoys fulfilling the role the former western colonial powers. for one, it’s lucrative for russia sell weapons and arms syria. the syrian conflict also gives russia place run military exercises. it’s powerful means for putin project dominance the world stage. and, most importantly, syria arena for russia challenge the presumption that the old colonial powers––the british and the french, and the new ones, the americans, who back the saudi arabians and the gulf states––are the real power the region. putin doesn’t agree with that assumption. the syrian civil war monkey wrench the russians can throw into arab regional relations, and into world politics. bashar al-assad learned from his dad this global game-playing amongst the world powers how one retains power syria. you leverage outsider power control your own people.', 'syria not free and independent nation. has yet achieve that goal. and the people pay for that failure. millions innocent people, unfortunate have been born syria, must live the murderous intersection tribalism, religious and sectarian divides, proxy warfare foreign powers, and wartime capitalism. their lives are unfairly marred the original sins turkish and subsequent european colonialism. their supreme leader, president bashar al-assad, just the latest symptom devastating disease. he’s playing role not written for him, and thus does the only thing knows works: vicious and cunning dear ol’ daddy, hafez.', 'history doesn’t repeat, but does rhyme. this may why syria remains bloody cluster-fuck. there’s end sight because one working the sources the tensions. instead, well-meaning outsiders are overwhelmed the endless cycles violence, even they’re occasionally motivated into action the pitiful looks the faces helpless children. the people doomed live syria lack the ability overcome all these various forces working against them. survival their best hope. hell, they just tried wage revolution for their freedom from tyranny. you see where that got them. the last years have been the government’s answer. plus, it’s not like america’s going any serious and committed nation-building guided the tiny hands donald trump and his under-staffed and under-funded state department. and, the russians? well, all know they aren’t known for spreading democracy. there peaceful escape for the people from the murderous reign bashar al-assad.', 'the only person who’s successfully held power syria was socialist gangster military mastermind from ethnic minority. who you think the eye doctor son who accidentally became president after his older brother died car crash going emulate? the story his father, hafez, sheds light ugly truth: for the foreseeable future, with russia’s backing, bashar will guarantee that syria remains bloody slaughterhouse killing floor.', 'how many hundreds thousands lives were lost because that one car accident? big brother basil may not have been better president, but it’s difficult picture would’ve been more monstrous than his little brother bashar. but, who knows? basil may have tried surpass his father’s cruelty, and may have exceeded bashar’s civilian-killing ways. that’s not the best question ask. the only good and important question ask is:', 'what can possibly save the people syria from this endless cycle violence that’s predictable the sweep the arms murderous clock?', 'in other words, when will syria finally free and independent nation? right now, america and russia continue bomb hospitals syria, they try defeat isis. meanwhile, the russians aim keep bashar al-assad power, while the americans give aid the rebels looking depose him, the same rebels that are aligned with the latest fundamentalist sunni islamists, ones you know best as…al qaeda. that’s right. syria, america uneasy partners with qaeda. that’s syria.', 'and that’s been syria for the last 100 years. that’s why refugees are desperate leave, the same ones president trump has banned from entering the u.s. the same refugees that drown the mediterranean, desperate reach europe. the west drew the imaginary lines the sand that created syria. that original betrayal arabs the west the reason why syria became hell earth. it’s easy ignore the truth that statement you blame bashar and hafez al-assad
