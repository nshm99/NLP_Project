nulis jadi mari kita langsung point tulisan adalah opini pribadi selama jadi pegawai berbagai industri selama tahun terakhir juga cerita dari beberapa rekan yang suka curhat intinya tidak menyasar pada satu perusahaan tertentu well kalau terbaca demikian udah jangan baper justru saatnya berbenah diri bukan pernah dengar nggak kalo dunia perkantoran kerja drama bisa dibilang benarnya kerjaan kita bisa dibilang benda mati nggak bernafas nggak kaya merawat tanaman atau merawat hewan yang masih bisa berinteraksi tantangannya adalah kerjaan kita yang benda mati harus dikerjakan oleh manusia yang mana manusia tahu sendiri kompleksnya kaya satu perusahaan anggap saja minimal pegawainya orang masalah kepala yang berusaha untuk menjadi satu bahumembahu yakin untuk mencapai tujuan utama perusahaan yaitu mendapatkan keuntungan plis jangan ajak ngomong message atau mengubah dunia dulu orangnya practical banget nanti belakangan kita sebut saja manusiamanusia tersebut mulai mereka yang tukang jilat mereka yang gila kredit mereka yang ademadem yang penting terima gaji bulanan mereka yang orangnya business usual banget pokoknya udahlah nggak perlu berkontribusi lebih sama perusahaan juga yang berusaha kera tapi kelihatan lebay karena strategis yang gede doang omongnya tapi suruh implementasi yawla nihil belum lagi dengan segala politik lobi melobi entah untuk tujuantujuan tertentu yang hanya mereka gusti allah yang tahu dari keadaan tersebut berpikir kebanyakan soal office politic nggak diketahui sama mereka yang mungkin fresh graduate atau tipetipe yang penting manut lebih parah lagi yang suka tidak sadar sedang terjebak dalam office politic ngikutin arus sampai akhirnya tenggelam jadi korban tanpa sadari udah male gitu berkontribusi perusahaan tersebut jadi share beberapa tentang office politic yang kirakira bisa menjadi kitab pegangan kalian biar plis jangan clueless gitu jadi orang bukan ngajarin orang jadi jahat tapi justru bisa membuat kalian punya pandangan perspektif baru soal kerja kantor yang nggak selalu soal berkarya dapat gaji kalo kantor gada office politic drama anak seneng banget pasti karena turnovernya pasti bakal rendah bukan kisah pribadi tapi dari teman jadi cerita startup tempat bekerja bahkan clevelnya ngegank gitu contoh anak kesayangan atau kesayangannya tapi gank sama head gitu kaum minoritynya clevel yang lain entah bingung diceritain sekolahan perusahaan main gank begitu intinya yang kelihatan kecil begini bisa ngaruh sampai misalnya approval budget lalu approval ideide yang diluncurkan market lantas kita sebagai cucunguk yang tengah bagaimana dong bersikap pilihan selalu kembali diri jadi ignorant dengan tetap kerja tapi tidak menjilat biasa atau malah memanfaatkan kesempatan untuk mendapatkan nama atau posisi serta apresiasi yang lebih besar trust seperti termasuk dalam office politic sebut saja bekerja sebuah perusahaan yang kerjanya kurang lebih seperti customer service ditawarkan promosi menjadi seorang supervisor karena kerjanya selalu baik attitude bagus pokoknya jarang cari masalah juga bergaul dengan banyak orang mulai dari level manajer hingga staff anaknya supel semua orang senang sama tapi salah seorang leader yang melihat bahwa main sama orang yang resign yang ternyata punya masalah sama leader padahal yang tadi bilang main sama semua orang akhirnya sejak pertama kali ditanyakan soal promosi tidak pernah dapat update apapun usut punya usut sang leader agak malas mengetahui masih main sama orang yang punya masalah resign bingung maunya profesional teman luar kantor sudah teman kenapa harus disangkutpautkan dengan karirnya dalam kantor tersebut hanya bisa bersabar menunggu padahal excitementnya sudah begitu tinggi waktu mendengar bahwa akan dipromosikan kebingungannya sekarang juga belum terjawab menurutnya jadi serba salah keadaan yang saat alkisah hidup sebuah startup antah berantah jauh negeri khayalan intinya prinsipnya bring seorang problem solver yang melihat bahwa segala sesuatu pasti solusinya walaupun prosesnya panjang semua sebetulnya modal skill pengalaman juga tapi sayangnya setiap makhlukmakhluk seperti selalu cucunguk macam yang merasa ingin mendapatkan yang sama tapi gada projectnya gitu yang orangnya practical realistis anti basabasi ujungujungnya jadi korban punya backingan apapun bekerja sebagaimana harus bekerja yaitu memberikan kontribusi bagi perusahaan tapi pasti orangorang yang entah kurang piknik hidupnya situsitu yang envy sama akhirnya mencari jalan ninja untuk semacam menendang orang keluar dengan kekuatan bekingan dari bapak yang paling kuat untungnya pintar anti drama memilih mundur terhormat membiarkan perusahaan beberapa waktu kemudian keadaannya begitu progress enggak mundur juga enggak dari cerita atas rasa masih banyak ceritacerita office politic lain yang beredar yang selalu mengisi ruangruang kantin makan siang sewaktu belum corona bumbubumbu pedas yang tersebar lewat obrolan grup tanpa serta medium lainnya office politic sudah sejak lama akan terus lantas untuk menghadapi office politic tentu saja tapi pastinya akan semudah diimplementasikan semua orang semua perusahaan karena memang treatmentnya harus case case banget beberapa saran nulis kepanjangan malah nanti kebanyakan kepala kalian nggak bisa memproses walau office politic menyebalkan tapi percayalah karena kita bisa tumbuh menjadi dewasa dalam dunia kerja juga kalo ambil sisi positifnya good luck
