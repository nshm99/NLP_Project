malas nulis jadi mari kita langsung point aja btw tulisan ini adalah opini pribadi selama jadi pegawai berbagai industri selama tahun terakhir juga cerita dari beberapa rekan yang suka curhat gue intinya ini tidak menyasar pada satu perusahaan tertentu well kalau terbaca demikian udah sih jangan baper justru saatnya berbenah diri bukan pernah dengar nggak sih kalo dunia perkantoran itu kerja dan 99 drama bisa dibilang ada benarnya kerjaan kita kan bisa dibilang benda mati nggak bernafas nggak kaya merawat tanaman atau merawat hewan yang masih bisa berinteraksi tantangannya adalah kerjaan kita yang benda mati itu kan harus dikerjakan oleh manusia yang mana manusia itu tahu sendiri kan kompleksnya kaya apa satu perusahaan anggap saja minimal pegawainya orang aja nah masalah tuh kepala yang berusaha untuk menjadi satu bahumembahu eh yakin untuk mencapai tujuan utama perusahaan yaitu mendapatkan keuntungan plis jangan ajak gue ngomong big message atau mengubah dunia dulu ya gue orangnya practical banget itu nanti aja belakangan kita sebut saja manusiamanusia tersebut mulai mereka yang tukang jilat bos mereka yang gila kredit mereka yang ademadem bae yang penting terima gaji bulanan mereka yang orangnya business usual banget pokoknya udahlah nggak perlu berkontribusi lebih sama perusahaan ada juga yang berusaha kera tapi kelihatan lebay karena gak strategis ada yang gede doang omongnya tapi pa suruh implementasi yawla nihil bos belum lagi dengan segala politik lobi melobi entah untuk tujuantujuan tertentu yang hanya mereka dan gusti allah yang tahu dari keadaan tersebut gue berpikir nih kebanyakan soal office politic tuh nggak diketahui sama mereka yang mungkin fresh graduate atau tipetipe yang penting manut aja lebih parah lagi ada yang suka tidak sadar dia sedang terjebak dalam office politic dan ngikutin arus aja sampai akhirnya tenggelam dan end jadi korban tanpa dia sadari dia udah male aja gitu berkontribusi perusahaan tersebut jadi gue mau share ini beberapa hal tentang office politic yang kirakira bisa menjadi kitab pegangan kalian biar plis deh jangan clueless gitu loh jadi orang iya ini bukan ngajarin orang jadi jahat ya tapi justru bisa membuat kalian punya pandangan dan perspektif baru soal kerja kantor yang nggak selalu soal berkarya dan dapat gaji aja kalo kantor gada office politic dan drama wah anak seneng banget pasti karena turnovernya pasti bakal rendah eh ini bukan kisah pribadi ya tapi dari teman jadi dia cerita startup tempat dia bekerja bahkan clevelnya tuh ngegank gitu loh contoh ada aja nih anak kesayangan ceo atau kesayangannya cmo tapi gank ceo ini sama coo dan head apa gitu kaum minoritynya clevel yang lain entah gue bingung sih pa diceritain ini sekolahan apa perusahaan kok main gank begitu intinya hal yang kelihatan kecil begini bisa ngaruh sampai misalnya approval budget lalu approval ideide yang mau diluncurkan market lantas kita nih sebagai cucunguk yang tengah bagaimana dong bersikap pilihan selalu kembali diri lo mau jadi ignorant dengan tetap kerja tapi tidak menjilat dan biasa aja atau malah memanfaatkan kesempatan ini untuk mendapatkan nama atau posisi serta apresiasi yang lebih besar trust hal seperti ini ada dan ini termasuk dalam office politic sebut saja bekerja sebuah perusahaan yang kerjanya kurang lebih seperti customer service ditawarkan promosi menjadi seorang supervisor karena kerjanya selalu baik attitude bagus pokoknya jarang cari masalah dia juga bergaul dengan banyak orang mulai dari level manajer hingga staff anaknya supel dan semua orang senang sama dia tapi ada nih salah seorang leader yang melihat bahwa ini main sama orang yang resign yang ternyata punya masalah sama leader ini padahal ini kan yang tadi bilang main sama semua orang akhirnya sejak pertama kali ditanyakan soal promosi tidak pernah dapat update apapun usut punya usut sang leader agak malas mengetahui ini masih main sama orang yang punya masalah dan resign ini pun bingung dia maunya profesional aja teman luar kantor sudah teman aja kenapa harus disangkutpautkan dengan karirnya dalam kantor tersebut pun hanya bisa bersabar menunggu padahal excitementnya sudah begitu tinggi waktu dia mendengar bahwa akan dipromosikan kebingungannya sekarang juga belum terjawab menurutnya jadi serba salah keadaan yang ada saat ini alkisah hidup sebuah startup antah berantah nun jauh negeri khayalan intinya ini prinsipnya bring deh dia seorang problem solver yang melihat bahwa segala sesuatu pasti ada solusinya walaupun prosesnya panjang semua itu sebetulnya ada modal skill dan pengalaman juga tapi sayangnya setiap makhlukmakhluk seperti selalu ada cucunguk macam yang merasa dia ingin mendapatkan hal yang sama tapi gada projectnya gitu loh yang orangnya practical realistis anti basabasi ini ujungujungnya jadi korban dan punya backingan apapun bekerja sebagaimana dia harus bekerja yaitu memberikan kontribusi bagi perusahaan tapi pasti lah ada orangorang yang entah kurang piknik hidupnya situsitu aja yang envy sama dia akhirnya mencari jalan ninja untuk semacam menendang orang ini keluar dengan kekuatan bekingan dari bapak yang paling kuat untungnya pintar dan anti drama dia memilih mundur terhormat dan membiarkan perusahaan ini beberapa waktu kemudian keadaannya begitu deh progress enggak mundur juga enggak nah dari cerita atas gue rasa masih banyak ceritacerita office politic lain yang beredar yang selalu mengisi ruangruang kantin makan siang sewaktu belum ada corona bumbubumbu pedas yang tersebar lewat obrolan grup tanpa bos serta medium lainnya office politic sudah ada sejak lama dan akan terus ada lantas ada tip sih untuk menghadapi office politic oh tentu saja ada tapi pastinya ini akan semudah itu diimplementasikan semua orang semua perusahaan karena memang treatmentnya harus case case banget ini beberapa saran gue dah ah nulis kepanjangan malah nanti kebanyakan kepala kalian dan nggak bisa memproses walau office politic menyebalkan tapi percayalah karena itu kita bisa tumbuh dan menjadi dewasa dalam dunia kerja itu juga kalo ambil sisi positifnya ya good luck
