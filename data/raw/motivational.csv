Then there were other restrictions inherent to working in a large organization about how to do the work, what work to do, what goals to set, and what business was worth pursuing. This situation was squeezing me into doing things that I’d rather not do, and vice versa.', 'What kind of work would I do if I had to do it forever? Not something that I did until I reached some milestone (an exit), but something that I would consider satisfactory if I continued to do it until I’m 80. What is out there that I could do that would make me excited waking up every day for the next 45 years that could also earn me enough money to cover my expenses? Is that too unambitious?

For instance, I’m not automatically driven to do my tax returns every April, but I make sure I do because I don’t want to go to prison. Or I might not want to work on something I dislike, but I do so anyway because I may need to pay the bills, or want to buy a fancy car. These are the extrinsic motivators.', 'The other comes from within. This is what drives me to do things when there isn’t a carrot or a stick. Hobbies are one activity driven by this. But what I was looking for was something that I could do for a living that was also driven by this type of motivation: the intrinsic kind.', 'Back to the question of whether this is too unambitious. See, I realized that extrinsic motivation doesn’t last. Whenever I got promoted, it felt good for a week, and then it was as over. When I first hit $100K income, I would take a peek at my W2 for a few days admiring the six digits, but then it wore off. When I hit $200K, $300K, $400K, and $500K, it was the same thing. I would be delusional to think that earning $1M, or $10M would suddenly make it different. And I feel the same with every other extrinsic reward or material possession. Getting them feels good for a while, but this wears off quickly.', 'The things that don’t wear off are those that I’ve been doing since I was a kid, when nothing was forcing me to do them. Things such as writing code, selling my creations, charting my own path, calling it like I saw it. I know my strengths, and I know what motivates me, so why not do this all the time? I’m lucky to live in a time where I can do something independently in my area of expertise without requiring large amounts of capital or outside investors. So that’s what I’m doing.', 'I’m going all in on independence, and I’m going to try to make a living with my own bare hands starting from nothing. I don’t expect to only do things that I like, but it will be on my terms. My target is to cover my family’s expenses before I run out of savings while doing something that intrinsically motivates me. What more would I ever want to be satisfied with my work?']"

Thus, goal-setting on its own needs to be paired with plans, systems or habits if it is going to be successful.', 'A good heuristic for goal-setting is that they should be SMART (specific, measureable, attainable, relevant and time-bound). Implementation intentions formulated as IF… THEN… plans tend to work better than just focusing on an outcome on its own. Planning fallacies also need to be watched for as many goal-setting efforts can be overly optimistic.', 'Some view the disadvantages of explicit goal-setting to outweigh the benefits. These people either argue for being entirely process-oriented and ignoring outcomes or simply negate the value of achievement itself in favor of different values.', 'If you’re looking to dive deeper into goal-setting, I recommend:', 'Systems are tools that structure your behavior and decision with formal rules.

What you ought to value in life and how you derive meaning from things are deep questions that we’ve debated for millennia. Even self-improvement itself is a perspective, one for which some pundits argue explicitly against.', 'There are two levels that this issue can be approached. The first is to find a system of meaning or values that you want to self-consciously emulate. This could be Stoicism, Buddhism, Christianity or some kind of secular humanism.

You might decide that happiness is the meaning of life or that the purpose of our lives transcends how we feel in the moment.', 'The second level of this system is to investigate meaning itself.

Some would classify a belief as a propositional statement in your head, like a little bit of logic with TRUE or FALSE attached. Others would see beliefs as statements of probability (90% TRUE or 54% FALSE). Still, others might argue that beliefs don’t really exist in our head at all, but are only inferrable by our behavior. In this sense, we act as if we had beliefs, but don’t really have anything corresponding to probabilities or propositions inside our minds.', 'Regardless of the exact format of thoughts and beliefs, they form a core concept in self-improvement for multiple reasons.', 'The first is that beliefs and thoughts may become self-fulfilling prophecies. Many argue that since your thoughts and beliefs have a causal impact on your behavior, and thus your results, you may get into cycles of self-limiting beliefs that become true only because you believe in them.', 'Thoughts can also create emotional feelings as well, and thus we may want to control our thoughts even if we don’t care so much about changing our external outcomes. The constant worrier may have a nagging voice in her head that says her success never counts.', 'The importance of thoughts and beliefs ranges depending on whom you ask. For some, beliefs have mystical powers that transcend a physically justifiable version of reality. To believe something is, in a certain sense, to literally make it true. Others reject the supernatural but argue that beliefs still highly constrain our attention, making self-fulfilling prophecies frequent. On the opposite extreme are those that argue for a mostly passive role of beliefs, recording the world but not changings outcomes much. To those people, having true beliefs matters more than believing things to make them true. Regardless of where you sit in this spectrum, the content of our thoughts and beliefs is central to self-improvement.', 'If you want to go deeper into this topic, I recommend:', 'There certainly are other concepts in self-improvement I’ve skipped over here.

For example, while having successfully “improved himself” to the nth degree, and having experienced incredible success, Ferriss found that he still struggled with his mental health: “Certainly I found myself, after checking a lot of those boxes, still suffering.”', 'Whatever self-improvement methodologies Tim was using had ultimately been a distraction — noise — from what would aid him in his mental health struggle.', 'It doesn’t matter how much money you have or how much you’ve accomplished if you’re still just as miserable and ashamed of who you are — distracting yourself from yourself. In this case, the money and accomplishments only prolong the suffering.', 'Much of what we call self-improvement is really just a band-aid for deeply rooted pain.

Radical Acceptance directly dismantles the very foundations of this trance.”', 'This sense of unworthiness cannot be remedied with competition, productivity, or any form of external success. And any self-improvement philosophy or practice which is fundamentally about compensating for this inner pain will only ever fail to improve your experience of life, your happiness, and your peace.', 'However, this isn’t to say that we must throw out the baby of self-improvement with the toxic bathwater we often find it in. Brach writes,', 'This doesn’t mean that we can’t compete in a healthy way, put whole hearted commitment into work or acknowledge and take pleasure in our own competence. But when our efforts are driven by the fear that we are flawed, we deepen the trance of unworthiness.', 'Tim Ferriss’s goal has always been to quantify his journey so his followers could learn from him and progress faster. And with this recent revelation, it seems he has made a giant leap in that direction.', 'By exploring the vast universe of self-improvement and self-optimization and coming up short, Ferriss’s new understanding serves as a lesson to us all: don’t waste your time with the “noise”. Instead, build a foundation of self-awareness and radical self-acceptance, and then you can consider enjoying the practical advantages of improving your productivity and external success.', 'The self-improvement world needs to change. In our tireless pursuit of improvement, we’re often just masking our inner pain of unworthiness. Each of us knows this, to one degree or another. To move forward, we must turn off the noise and face our true selves without judgement — only then can we hope to experience any authentic change or improvement.']"

The screen is encroaching on the eye, from TVs to computer monitors to phone screens to smartwatches to VR goggles to tiny LEDs that project images onto the retina to neural implants that communicate directly with the optic nerve.', 'With each leap in human–machine intimacy, resolution increases, and our utility value is improved along some measurable metric. This is the mindset encouraged by wristbands that count our heartbeats and footsteps under the pretense of improved health or life extension. Health, happiness, and humanity itself are all reducible to data points and subject to optimization.', 'We are all just numbers: the quantified self.', 'Like a music recording that can be reduced to code and stored in a file, the quantified human can also be reduced to bits, replicated infinitely, uploaded to the cloud, or installed in a robot. But only the metrics we choose to follow are recorded and translated. Those we don’t value, or don’t even know about, are discarded in the new model.', 'Improved longevity, supercognition, or military prowess all sound promising until we consider what is being left behind, whose values are being expressed (and whose aren’t), and how these choices change the larger systems of which we are a part. Just as life-saving antibiotics also strengthen bacteria and weaken the collective immune system, or as steroids improve short-term performance at the expense of long-term health, there are trade-offs. We—or the companies selling the improvements—are actively picking which features of humanity to enhance and which to suppress or ignore. In amplifying an individual’s brainpower, we may inadvertently disable some of their ability to connect with others or achieve organismic resonance. What of racial diversity, gender fluidity, sexual orientation, or body type? The human traits that are not favored by the market will surely be abandoned.', 'Could that happen to a civilization as supposedly enlightened as our own? Our track record suggests it will.', 'The internet’s tremendous social and intellectual potential was surrendered to short-term market priorities, turning a human-centered medium into a platform for manipulation, surveillance, and extraction. The more we see the human being as a technology to be enhanced, the greater the danger of applying this same market ethos to people, and extending our utility value at the expense of others. Life extension becomes the last-ditch attempt of the market to increase our available timeline as consumers—and consumers willing to spend anything for that extra few years of longevity.', 'Sure, many of us would accept a digital implant if it really worked as advertised. Who wouldn’t want some painless enhancements, free of side effects? Or the choice of when or whether to die? Besides, participation in the ever-changing economy requires some acquiescence to technology, from streetcars and eyeglasses to elevators and computers.', 'But our technological investments come with strings. The deals are not honest; they’ve never been. Companies change their user agreements. Or they sell the printers at a loss and then overcharge us for the ink cartridges. The technologies we are currently bringing into our lives turn us into always-on customers—more like subscribers than purchasers, never really owning or fully controlling what we’ve bought. Operating system upgrades render our hardware obsolete, forcing us to buy new equipment. How long until that chip in my brain, and the neurons that grew around it, are obsolete?', 'It’s not that wanting to improve ourselves, even with seemingly invasive technology, is so wrong. It’s that we humans should be making active choices about what it is we want to do to ourselves, rather than letting the machines, or the markets propelling them, decide for us.']"

It’s a beautiful four-word sentence that immediately switched my thinking while also affirming everything my experience had been telling me. Goals are for losers. What could that possibly mean?', 'For one thing, goals lead to a strange sense of letdown once they’re achieved. Wednesday’s post talked about “post achievement depression.” The best description of this effect is found in Scott Adams’ book:', 'If you achieve your goal, you celebrate and feel terrific, but only until you realize you just lost the thing that gave you purpose and direction.', 'Goals are like matches. They can start a fire. And that’s great but the fire burns out eventually and you have to find another match. It’s akin to the standard motivational cycle. You hype yourself up to do something, get it done, and then have to hype yourself up again. And what about those times that you don’t achieve your goals? I’ve had this happen to me quite often, practically every day, and it always led to anger and frustration before reading this book.', 'There must be some other way.', 'Adams argues for a systems approach.', 'For our purposes, let’s say a goal is a specific objective that you either achieve or don’t sometime in the future. A system is something you do on a regular basis that increases your odds of happiness in the long run. If you do something every day, it’s a system. If you’re waiting to achieve it someday in the future, it’s a goal.', 'When I first read this, I had already become a creature of strange habit. I had a system of sorts. And I had already stumbled on the idea of emergence so I understood that my habits were what drove a lot of my ability. But the habits were a little clunky and I was still enamored with the chase (I must achieve this thing) rather than the daily practice and the idea of multiple pursuits.', 'So Adams’ idea seemed like a great connection between the findings of Cal Newport’s book “Deep Work” and Ericsson’s “Peak”. This was especially true with the view towards energy.', 'Energy', 'Adams argues that energy is the most vital resource for anyone’s success. I think we’ve all experienced this. When your energy is high, every possibility opens up. The trick is to understand that this energy isn’t the result of your emotions; it’s the other way around. And energy, like all such resources, can be cultivated.', 'Here’s where we get to the boring, obvious stuff; the stuff you already know and maybe want to ignore. Adams writes below:', 'The most important form of selfishness involves spending time on your fitness, eating right, pursuing your career, and still spending quality time with your family and friends.', 'When I read this the first time, I felt a little guilt and some mild irritation. I paid fifteen bucks to read this? But the next line hit me pretty hard.', 'I’m giving you permission to take care of yourself first, so you can do a better job of being generous in the long run.', 'The argument here is that the lack of self-care will only create a lack of energy and thus a real problem for your mental and physical state. Seems obvious but it’s the phrase at the beginning that gets me: “I’m giving you permission ….” That’s powerful because we career-minded ambitious types never do this for ourselves; I think we actually wait for someone to tell us to do this and Adams knows it. Furthermore, he knows that self-care helps us care for others in the long run. Hence the word “generous” in his quote.', 'Some people would say this is where one needs a hobby. Trouble is, I don’t really have hobbies. I don’t think I understand hobbies. Hence the lack of self-care.', 'What Adams basically argues is that hobby or not, there are things you can do that will create and sustain the right amount of energy which then leads to better states of mind and body. So you aren’t a weekend fisherman? Don’t belong to a quilting circle? Big deal. The real advice stands regardless: exercise, eat right, pursue career, spend time with friends and family.', 'These things need to be done every day. These are the foundations of the system. By doing them every day, you eliminate the strain of choice. These things steadily become force of habit. And as Jerry Seinfeld would say, doing them every day helps you make sure you don’t break the chain.', 'The idea of doing these things every day fixed a real problem. Prior to this point, I had suffered serious inconsistency issues with fitness. I would tell myself, “Work out three days a week. Start with that modest goal. Then go to four days.”', 'Sounds good but that day in-between is a killer. You take one day off and then, somehow, you take two days off. Then three.', 'Now you’re straying from the goal and feeling frustrated. Frustration saps energy. Not working out drains energy. Next thing you know, you’re so tired you don’t work out at all.', 'A lot of research has demonstrated that exercise actually creates energy. So what’s the takeaway?', 'Do it every day. If you planned on working out three times a week, thirty minutes each time, it is far better to stretch those 90 minutes over seven days a week. Better to work out 13 minutes every day than 30 minutes 3 days a week. This is the systems approach.', 'Consider this, too: there is no goal here. Most times, people work out because they want to lose weight or run a 5k. And again, forgive the repetition, but what happens once the 5k is complete? The weight is lost? We sense what is known as the regression to the mean. Whatever happens to be your average day, your “mean” set of routines, is what you return to. The 5k was just a short-lived intervention; a brief affair.', 'By the way, this doesn’t really have anything to do with fitness. Exercise is simply a metaphor. Apply this to the workplace and the logic stands. For example, we often want to be responsive with customer service. But we don’t just go in spurts of super-responsiveness (e.g., I’ll answer every call on the first ring this week). Instead, we make a standard, such as responding to all voicemails within 24 hours, and we hold to it every day.', 'So the system is Adams’ way of saying we must elevate our average day with a mindful, regular practice. We must make it better than the stuff of the Beatles lyric:', 'Woke up, fell out of bed', 'Dragged a comb across my head', 'Found my way downstairs and drank a cup', 'And looking up I noticed I was late', 'Found my coat and grabbed my hat', 'Made the bus in seconds flat', 'Made my way upstairs and had a smoke', 'And everybody spoke and I went into a dream', 'Compare this with Adams’ description of his mornings when working a full-time job:', 'Most people aren’t lucky enough to have a flexible schedule. I didn’t have one either for the first sixteen years of my corporate life. So I did the next best thing by going to bed early and getting up at 4:00 A.M. to do my creative side projects. One of those projects became the sketches for Dilbert.', 'A fellow member of the 4:00 A.M. club. No wonder I love this book.', 'Simplicity vs Optimization', 'So systems. Right. Got it. But I ran into trouble with this idea right away. At work and at home. In both places, I started implementing routines and structures in the best fashion of LEAN practice, developing KPIs and feedback loops like some finely-tuned machine. I had a whole framework going and I had never been more miserable! It was terrible!', 'Terrible because Adams touches on something I knew but wanted to ignore: complexity makes things more difficult. It gets to a great dichotomy that he sets up later in the book, the difference between simplifiers and optimizers.', 'Some people are what I call simplifiers and some are optimizers. A simplifier will prefer the easy way to accomplish a task, while knowing that some amount of extra effort might have produced a better outcome. An optimizer looks for the very best solution even if the extra complexity increases the odds of unexpected problems.', 'To my great shame and humiliation, I am a consummate optimizer despite the fact I want to be a simplifier. But when you mix this knowledge with what we’ve seen from Gary Klein’s book, Sources of Power, it starts to make sense. We are optimizers in every realm where we lack expertise. We build elaborate plans and systems in these places. An eager beginner to weight-lifting comes with an exercise log, pre-made sequence of lifts, quarterly benchmarks, and a post-workout protein shake. A long-time lifter just shows up at the gym.', 'So to split a hair in Adams’ framework, the reality is that we all have a bit of simplifier and a bit of optimizer within us. Since I was new to building a daily system, my first few iterations (from two years ago) were much too elaborate. Here’s an example below:', 'Exhausting, right? Over time, I redefined a number of these, combined a few, and eliminated #6 and #7 altogether. They weren’t needed once my tastes changed. (There’s a great amount of content in this book about how to mentally realign your food cravings and the techniques certainly worked for me.)', 'Today, the system is much more simple, lightweight, and strategic. True to the Pareto Principle, my daily practice underscores an 80/20 balance of what matters most. Roughly 20% of my day is committed to fulfilling the daily habits that, in turn, dictate the quality of the remaining 80% of the day.', 'I really dislike making this about me but it’s the best way to explain the concept.', 'That said, I’ve been doing this in the workplace for a while now. I’m still tinkering with the approach but it’s true to the tenets we find in the book review for Essentialism. Future posts and book reviews will show how this is carried out. For those who are familiar, a lot of it translates to practices found in Agile and Scrum techniques.', 'Compounding Interests', 'Monday’s post was about the ratchet, the self-propelling virtuous/vicious cycles that take on a momentum of their own. The systems approach is all about creating ratchets with skill development. As Adams explains below:', 'A great strategy for success in life is to become good at something, anything, and let that feeling propel you to new and better victories. Success can be habit-forming.', 'Not only can it be habit-forming, it can also be opportunity-forming. Another great line from the book: Where there is a tolerance for risk, there is often talent.', 'Talent leads to initial skill development. This creates the initial ratchet and, over time, it creates a higher comfort level with risk. Or better yet, I think it leads to a deeper understanding of risk.', 'But that’s not to say that you aren’t talented unless you step out and do something stupid. The risk, I think, is more of the dance with failure that occupies the Tuesday and Thursday posts about right-sizing our “shot attempts” and achieving “net positive failure”. Failure, if you remember, can be managed. Risk can be managed, too.', 'But what really helps solidify the connection between talent and risk is to see “talent” as the basis for skill development. New skills create better risk profiles. Adams writes it this way: “Every skill you acquire doubles your odds of success.”', 'This is absolutely true. To put a finer point on it, Adams offers this: Good + Good > Excellent.', 'In my case, I have some skill in graphic design. I have skill in writing. I have skill in data analysis. I have skill in presentation. None of these skills are “excellent” but, in combination, they create something unique and anything unique is inherently more valuable.', 'But this isn’t about me. You have a combination of good skills, too. The more you mix those skills together (and acquire new skills on top of them), the more you can do something that others can’t. It’s not that you and I are “jacks of all trades, masters of none”. That’s a dumb construct. The truth is that we can be “jacks of all trades” and thus be a master of delivering something useful from that mix. Mastery isn’t solely defined by the pre-constructed subjects you encounter in school. It can be defined in far more eloquent, reliable ways. But we’ll save that for another book review when we get to Robert Greene.', 'Conclusion: Seek Emergent Success', 'I’ll close with two final quotes from the book and encourage you to please grab a copy. There is far more to learn than what I can share here. The first quote is an offshoot of the old line from Seneca about how “Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.”', 'From Adams, it reads like this: Success isn’t magic; it’s generally the product of picking a good system and following it until luck finds you.', 'Second is a line that goes to the concept introduced in Thursday’s post about directional correctness:', 'Happiness has more to do with where you’re heading than where you are.', 'Whatever the context, work or personal, home or office, if you define and rely on a proper system that maintains a high level of energy, that energy will help you generate more skill, more knowledge, more ability. These skills, knowledge, and abilities will help you see risk differently. This will give you more opportunities. Altogether, those new opportunities will be pursuits built on top of a foundation (i.e., system) that always ensures you are moving in the right direction.', 'Heading in the right direction creates a feeling of rightness and progress and this, in turn, ensures net positive traction. It’s the ratchet.', 'And while it might seem like an act of faith, the reality is that tending to such things will undoubtedly lead to some sort of success. So ignore the goal-oriented stuff. Avoid the post achievement depression. A single track for a single goal is not resilient. Building a system, an infrastructure, that can support multiple goals, multiple initiatives, at the same time, is far better.', 'Designing your system isn’t easy. I’ve been doing it for two years now. There have been multiple drafts, believe me. But once it starts moving, you can’t stop it. And they can’t stop you.', 'So much more to learn. Buy the book on Amazon.', 'Mental Models and Principles']"

His duties took him to what are now Spain and France and as far away as North Africa. Vitruvius later became an architect and worked on a temple, no longer in existence, in the town of Fano in Italy. His most important work was literary, the only surviving book on architecture from classical antiquity: De Architectura, known today as The Ten Books on Architecture.', 'For many dark centuries, Vitruvius’s work had been forgotten, but in the early 1400s it was one of the many pieces of classical writing, including Lucretius’s epic poem On the Nature of Things and Cicero’s orations, that were rediscovered and collected by the pioneering Italian humanist Poggio Bracciolini. At a monastery in Switzerland, Poggio found an eighth-century copy of Vitruvius’s opus, and he sent it back to Florence. There it became part of the firmament of rediscovered classical works that birthed the Renaissance. Brunelleschi used it as a reference when he traveled to Rome as a young man to measure and study the ruins of classical buildings, and Alberti quoted it extensively in his treatise on architecture. A Latin edition was published in the late 1480s by one of Italy’s new print shops, and Leonardo wrote in a notebook, “Enquire at the stationers about Vitruvius.”', 'What made Vitruvius’s work appealing to Leonardo was that it gave concrete expression to an analogy that went back to Plato and the ancients, one that had become a defining metaphor of Renaissance humanism: the relationship between the microcosm of man and the macrocosm of the earth.', 'Leonardo embraced the analogy in both his art and his science. He famously wrote around this time, “The ancients called man a lesser world, and certainly the use of this name is well bestowed, because his body is an analog for the world.”', 'Applying this analogy to the design of temples, Vitruvius decreed that the layout should reflect the proportions of a human body, as if the body were laid out flat on its back upon the geometric forms of the floor plan. “The design of a temple depends on symmetry,” he wrote at the outset of his third book. “There must be a precise relation between its components, as in the case of those of a well-shaped man.”', 'Vitruvius described in great detail the proportions of this “well-shaped man” that should inform the design of a temple. The distance from his chin to the top of his forehead should be one-tenth of his whole height, he began, and proceeded with many other such notations. “The length of the foot is one sixth of the height of the body; of the forearm, one fourth; and the breadth of the breast is also one fourth. The other members, too, have their own symmetrical proportions, and it was by employing them that the famous painters and sculptors of antiquity attained to great and endless renown.”', 'Vitruvius’s descriptions of human proportions would inspire Leonardo, as part of the anatomy studies he had just begun in 1489, to compile a similar set of measurements. More broadly, Vitruvius’s belief that the proportions of man are analogous to those of a well-conceived temple — and to the macrocosm of the world — became central to Leonardo’s worldview.', 'After detailing human proportions, Vitruvius went on to describe, in a memorable visualization, a way to put a man in a circle and square in order to determine the ideal proportion of a church:', 'In a temple there ought to be harmony in the symmetrical relations of the different parts to the whole. In the human body, the central point is the navel. If a man is placed flat on his back, with his hands and feet extended, and a compass centered at his navel, his fingers and toes will touch the circumference of a circle thereby described. And just as the human body yields a circular outline, so too a square may be found from it. For if we measure the distance from the soles of the feet to the top of the head, and then apply that measure to the outstretched arms, the breadth will be found to be the same as the height, as in the case of a perfect square.', 'It was a powerful image. But as far as we know, no one of note had made a serious and precise drawing along these lines in the fifteen centuries since Vitruvius composed his description. Then, around 1490, Leonardo and his friends proceeded to tackle this depiction of man spread-eagle amid a church and the universe.', 'Francesco di Giorgio produced at least three such drawings that were designed to accompany his treatise and translation of Vitruvius. One of them shows a sweet and dreamy image of a man in a circle and a square. It is a suggestive rather than precise drawing. The circle, square, and body do not attempt to show proportions and are instead rendered casually. Two other drawings that Francesco made depict a man more carefully proportioned inside a design of circles and squares in the shape of a church floor plan.', 'Around the same time, another dear friend of Leonardo produced a drawing based on Vitruvius’s passage. Giacomo Andrea was part of the collaborative circle of architects and engineers gathered by Ludovico at the court of Milan. Luca Pacioli, a mathematician at the court and another close friend of Leonardo, wrote a dedication to an edition of his book On Divine Proportion that listed the distinguished members of that court. After hailing Leonardo, Pacioli adds, “There was also Giacomo Andrea da Ferrara, as dear to Leonardo as a brother, a keen student of Vitruvius’s works.”', 'Andrea produced a simple version of a spread-armed man in a circle and a square. Notably, the circle and square are not centered; the circle rises higher than the square, which allows the man’s navel to be in the center of the circle and his genitals to be in the center of the square, like Vitruvius had suggested. The man’s arms are stretched outward, Christ-like, and his feet are close together.', 'Andrea would end up being killed and brutally quartered by French troops when they captured Milan nine years later. Shortly thereafter, Leonardo would search for and find his manuscript copy of Vitruvius’s work. “Messer Vincenzio Aliprando, who lives near the Inn of the Bear, has Giacomo Andrea’s Vitruvius,” he declared in a notebook entry.', 'In the 1980s, Andrea’s drawing was rediscovered. Architectural historian Claudio Sgarbi found a heavily illustrated manuscript copy of Vitruvius’s tome that was languishing in an archive in Ferrara, Italy. He determined that manuscript had been compiled by Andrea. Among its 127 illustrations was Andrea’s version of Vitruvian Man.', 'There are two key differences that distinguish Leonardo’s version of Vitruvian Man from those done around the same time by his two friends, Francesco di Giorgio and Giacomo Andrea. In both scientific precision and artistic distinction, Leonardo’s is in an entirely different realm.', 'Rarely on display, because prolonged exposure to light would cause it to fade, it is kept in a locked room on the fourth floor of the Gallerie dell’Accademia in Venice. When a curator brought it out and placed it before me on a table, I was struck by the indentations made by the stylus of Leonardo’s metalpoint pen and the twelve pricks made by the point of his compass. I had the eerie and intimate sensation of seeing the hand of the master at work more than five centuries earlier.', 'Unlike those of his friends, Leonardo’s drawing is meticulously done. His lines are not sketchy and tentative. Instead, he dug hard with his stylus, carving the lines confidently into the page as if he were making an etching. He had planned this drawing very carefully and knew precisely what he was doing.', 'Before he began, he had determined exactly how the circle would rest on the base of the square but extend out higher and wider. Using a compass and a set square, he drew the circle and the square, then allowed the man’s feet to rest comfortably on them. As a result, per Vitruvius’s description, the man’s navel is in the precise center of the circle, and his genitals are at the center of the square.', 'In one of the notes below the drawing, Leonardo described additional aspects of the positioning: “If you open your legs enough that your head is lowered by one-fourteenth of your height and raise your hands enough that your extended fingers touch the line of the top of your head, know that the center of the extended limbs will be the navel, and the space between the legs will be an equilateral triangle.”', 'Other notes on the page provide more detailed measurements and proportions, which he attributed to Vitruvius:', 'Vitruvius, architect, writes in his work on architecture that the measurements of man are distributed in this manner:', 'The length of the outspread arms is equal to the height of a man.', 'From the hairline to the bottom of the chin is one-tenth of the height of a man.', 'From below the chin to the top of the head is one-eighth of the height of a man.', 'From above the chest to the top of the head is one-sixth of the height of a man.', 'From above the chest to the hairline is one-seventh of the height of a man.', 'The maximum width of the shoulders is a quarter of the height of a man.', 'From the breasts to the top of the head is a quarter of the height of a man.', 'From the elbow to the tip of the hand is a quarter of the height of a man.', 'From the elbow to the armpit is one-eighth of the height of a man.', 'The length of the hand is one-tenth of the height of a man.', 'The root of the penis [Il membro virile] is at half the height of a man.', 'The foot is one-seventh of the height of a man.', 'Despite what he stated, instead of accepting what Vitruvius had written, Leonardo relied on his own experience and experiments, as per his creed. Fewer than half of the twenty-two measurements that Leonardo cited are the ones Vitruvius handed down. The rest reflect the studies on anatomy and human proportion that Leonardo had begun recording in his notebooks. For example, Vitruvius puts the height of a man at six times the length of his foot, but Leonardo records it as seven times.', 'In order to make his drawing an informative work of science, Leonardo could have used a simplified figure of a man. Instead, he used delicate lines and careful shading to create a body of remarkable and unnecessary beauty. With its intense but intimate stare and the curls of hair that Leonardo loved to draw, his masterpiece weaves together the human and the divine.', 'The man seems to be in motion, vibrant and energetic, just like the four-winged dragonflies that Leonardo studied. Leonardo has made us sense, almost see, one leg and then the other being pushed out and pulled back, the arms flapping as if in flight. There is nothing static except the calm torso, with subtle crosshatch shadings behind it. Yet despite the sense of motion, there is a natural and comfortable feel to the man. The only slightly awkward positioning is of his left foot, which is twisted outward to provide a measurement guide.', 'To what extent might Vitruvian Man be a self-portrait? Leonardo was thirty-eight when he drew it, about the age of the man in the picture. Contemporary descriptions emphasize his “beautiful curling hair” and “well-proportioned” body. Vitruvian Man echoes features seen in many assumed portraits of him, especially Bramante’s depiction of Heraclitus, which shows Leonardo still beardless at about that age. Leonardo once warned against falling prey to the axiom “Every painter paints himself,” but in a section in his proposed treatise on painting called “How Figures Often Resemble Their Masters,” he accepted that it was natural to do so.', 'The stare of Vitruvian Man is as intense as someone looking in a mirror, perhaps literally. According to Toby Lester, who wrote a book about the drawing, “It’s an idealized self-portrait in which Leonardo, stripped down to his essence, takes his own measure, and in doing so embodies a timeless human hope: that we just might have the power of mind to figure out how we fit into the grand scheme of things. Think of the picture as an act of speculation, a kind of metaphysical self-portrait in which Leonardo — as an artist, a natural philosopher, and a stand-in for all of humanity — peers at himself with furrowed brow and tries to grasp the secrets of his own nature.”', 'Leonardo’s Vitruvian Man embodies a moment when art and science combined to allow mortal minds to probe timeless questions about who we are and how we fit into the grand order of the universe. It also symbolizes an ideal of humanism that celebrates the dignity, value, and rational agency of humans as individuals. Inside the square and the circle we can see the essence of Leonardo da Vinci, and the essence of ourselves, standing naked at the intersection of the earthly and the cosmic.']"

She illustrates a great way to display sectors and transitions between scales. Often news portals hide their navigation tools when entering and leaving content. This can leave a user disoriented and confused about where they are in the interface relative to the rest of the content. This interface always keeps its menu around, but nicely transitions into a full screen view as well.', 'The idea of ranking content is not necessarily new, as many different platforms have utilized some sort of upvoting before. However, a rating system for articles — similar to Rotten Tomatoes — is interesting. In the age of content overload, readers appreciate knowing whether an article is worth a read or not. Upvoting systems reduce content overload, but this ranking system suggests an organizational structure for articles that will be worth reading well after they have been published.', 'The transition between calendar and main headlines offers an alternative way to consume content. Although this is a news platform specific to a concert hall, it suggests how similar institutions might align news content with upcoming events. The headline feed offers the featured content quickly, while the zoomed out calendar provides a broader scope of other programming.', 'Both Google Newsstand and Trello cards inspired this design. Can you tell? Salomon’s intent was to reconsider the pull gesture. Typically, the pull gesture is used to refresh the page. Salomon instead directs navigation in multiple directions and scales all with the single gesture type. The result is a smooth transition between menu and content.', 'This editorial prototype focuses more on aesthetic design choices rather than architectural ones. The design harkens to the style of conventional print media, and as a result, it gives the content a serious tone, which many news portals lack. The serif font, which has suited mobile, is easier to read over an extended period of time than the serif fonts, which are more common in most digital interfaces.', 'This is a relatively stripped down iteration of a news portal. In the context of often overly designed interfaces, this is actually somewhat refreshing. For users who just want to read, this interface does just that. The gentle contrast of the text on a light gray background provides a more comfortable reading experience for long form content, and images are removed from the article so readers can focus on, well, reading. The hero image provides the necessary visuals straight away, which removes any need for additional imagery set into the article.', 'This interface is well suited for the user quickly scanning headlines, rather than someone interested in a long read. The permanence of the menu on the side suggests a need to quickly switch between each portal, as if to scan headlines quickly while in transit or between meetings.', 'Yahoo’s news portal is unique because it automatically generates its content by sampling sources from around the internet. Yahoo extracts the essential pieces of information — images, quotes, maps — from stories around the web. Then, a small editorial team writes a brief summary. This results makes for an up to date and effortless reading experience.', 'This app, Timeline, does not just provide news stories, but it generates additional articles as historical context to produce a more in depth reading experience. Timeline is the perfect app for those who want more meaningful news content. The app has its own award winning editorial team that produces exclusive articles.', 'The interface allows readers to scale between the details of a story, or zoom out to the historical timeline of a topic to scan other recent or related articles.', 'This interface removes category pages. In its place, the content is organized within a single news feed and each article is tagged by topic. As a result, users can personalize their feeds to fit their unique interests. Despite the mix of content in a single feed, the design nicely unifies the different topics by overlaying a vibrant color scheme. Often, uncurated newsfeeds feel illegitimate or disorganized. This interface solves that with its underlying tag system and well-considered color scheme.', 'This wide-range of news UIs proves there are infinite solutions for designing a successful interface.

Many imperfect actions will get you far further than not doing anything at all. In fact, a daily habit of writing or training at the gym is just that- taking action, rarely ever perfect, day after day. These people are likely to change whether they read the self-help book, go to the seminar, or not. But they still read books and attend conferences because they understand and practice the principle of the slight edge: the little things they to do repeatedly lead to big changes in their lives.', 'This group of people change because of the effort they put into their personal development. Taking big action doesn’t come naturally to this group, as it does for the first. If the right seminar, coach, teacher or mentor lights a fire under their ass, they change and they become people in the first group. Often that nudge, or initial momentum is enough to get people moving. This is a tricky place to be because while external motivation is fine to get started, these people will have to find the discipline to stay on top of their habits- especially for the majority of the time when they don’t feel motivated. For this group, optimizing their environments is key. More on that shortly.', 'Dan Kennedy says a good amount of the people that buy his products never remove the shrink-wrap.

They think that the next course, book, or seminar will transform them in an instant, into the kind of person who is in the first or second group.

For this group especially, the environments are absolutely critical.', 'Regardless of where you are in these groups, the key to stacking the odds in your favor is to get rid of everything that may take away from your mission- which takes us into the importance of environments.', 'If you’ve ever been to a motivational seminar or conference, you’ve probably experienced the incredible “high” that occurs at the end of it.

But recognize that spending money on this stuff is like investing in your own stock- put the work in, and it’s very profitable long term.', 'Each time you upgrade one environment, all the others will be impacted.

James was a psychologist and later became a teacher. Freud was a neurologist.', 'But in the 20th century, philosophers became talkers of knowledge.

We don’t have enough, we aren’t good enough, etc, etc. This narrative blinds us to all we should be grateful for. It blinds us to our gifts and causes us to see the world through the lens of our weaknesses.', 'One of the strange paradoxes of personal development is that in order to make change, we have to begin by accepting the way things are, even if they are not ideal or to our liking.

The more clearly and precisely your goals are defined, the greater your chances of achieving them.', 'To support their statements, these motivation experts usually rely on an experiment done with the Yale class of 1953.', 'The study asked graduating Yale seniors if they had specific goals they wanted to achieve in the future that they wrote down on paper. Twenty years later, the researchers found that the 3% of students who had specific goals written down on paper were richer than the 97% of other students.', 'This would seem to prove that writing down your goals is the key to success.', 'Unfortunately, it’s not that simple.

The way in which the emotion is controlled is most important. If anger is controlled it does not go away, it is like kinetic energy that is used no matter what. Just as kinetic energy, that anger that is controlled is held by the person until the bursting point when the jar just spills over the top. But rather than keeping anger until the bursting point how about consuming this anger in a different way.', 'To put this into perspective we need a few ordinary scenarios. Let’s take for example unfairness.

Rather than just consuming yourself and you’re energy with anger how about consuming this anger towards energy and motivation?', 'A research conducted in November 2010 by the Association of Psychological Science, researchers find that associating an object with anger actually makes people want the object — a kind of motivation that’s normally associated with positive emotions. Looking at your life and comparing it to a person that might be having a higher quality of life compared to you would make you angry into wanting the luxuries that others have and you do not. Therefore it emotionally motivates you to strive towards a better quality of life.', 'This Ideology does go quite a bit towards Locke and Latham Goal-Setting Theory (1990). The anger must be concentrated on a target or a specific goal. The more intense the emotion the more focused the person should be towards that specific goal.

This is showing how anger can be converted into a different element (emotion or positive action).', 'A very interesting theory that goes adequate in perspective with this would be the recalibration theory of anger. This is a computational-evolutionary model that maintains the function of anger which is to recalibrate individuals who place insufficient weight on the welfare of the angry individual when making decisions or any irrational actions.', 'This theory refers more to uncontrollable anger and how individuals with such anger are convicted into this state of mind.

This action is triggered so that in the future the opposing individual will see the angry person’s interest more valuable.', 'The way that this theory is implemented with the ideology is withholding the weight created within the state of mind to, later on, be used towards motivation to represent not only a better state of mind towards the oppressing party but also indirectly avenge the negative opinion of an individual. Most of the perspectives would refer to arguments that end up in aggression but as I have talked in my previous article there is no gain for such however, individuals with uncontrollable anger may not see it.', 'The trigger which causes a mass effect of anger can be determined by something that has previously happened in an individual’s life and has left a mental scar. As such action can happen then would individuals be able to experience a high level of long term motivation caused by something happening in their life?', 'Being hurt mentally may affect someone to rise above the situation or above the oppressing party in order not only to heal from such mental scar or soul pain but also, to show yourself that as an individual you can do so much more to the point where motivation comes from the inner-self.

You’re picking someone with whom to share your life’s work. You’ll also share money, space, risk, and a whole lot of time.', 'The right partnership is powerful. Working with the wrong person can feel heavy and frustrating (at the very least) and, in the worst case, it can destroy the business.', 'That’s why a founders’ agreement should be excruciatingly detailed.

They want to recover their money fast, so they often pressure companies to expand quickly.', 'A hockey stick looks great on paper, but it typically requires the business to grow revenues first and figure out profits later.

As we focus on funding options, it’s easy to leave end users out of the conversation. Even the term “users” dehumanizes the people who will buy what we create. But bootstrapped companies ultimately answer to their customers, not to investors. We have an obligation to listen closely to customer needs , feedback , and ideas — and that’s a good thing.', 'Even criticism is great for business, because it pushes the team to stretch and innovate. Customer-funded growth keep us honest; they ensure we don’t stray off track. That’s a powerful advantage.', 'Never assume you know what customers want; you have to look at the data. We’re lucky to live in an era where we can create a hypothesis and then test it without overt bias. Making a product change? Release it to a small group and establish a clear way to measure user reactions. Apply what you learn and test again.', 'Testing doesn’t mean you’re beholden to customer whims, either. You create the “what,” and customers help to show you “how.” For example, Airbnb’s mission is to create “a world where people can belong through healthy travel that is local, authentic, diverse, inclusive and sustainable.” How, exactly they do that is still up to the smart people running the company.', 'According to surveys conducted for American Express:', 'The numbers are clear: customer service matters deeply. Support teams do much more than resolve tickets and answer tedious questions; they have a massive effect on company growth.', 'Sexy customer acquisition stats usually get the spotlight, but it’s better to spend time, energy, and money on satisfying existing customers than winning over new ones. In fact, data shows that it’s anywhere from 5 to 25 times more expensive to acquire a new customer than to keep a current one.', 'Extraordinary customer support doesn’t even require extraordinary efforts; you just need to consistently exceed expectations:', 'Bootstrapping is not a great way to get PR. And most self-funded entrepreneurs are too busy refining their product to worry about landing on magazine covers.', 'A little publicity certainly never hurts but what does the attention really do — especially if it’s about the business, not the product itself? Most customers don’t read industry or tech publications anyway. Once the attention fades, you’re still left with the same mission and the same challenges.', 'Highly-publicized funding rounds can also put you under a microscope.

Many other founders have been in Amoruso’s shoes, too. Well-funded startups that crash and burn often make headlines. With serious money often comes serious scrutiny.', 'Big-time investments can supercharge the startup (for better or worse), but slow growth can ensure you have a sane, happy personal life — even as you build a thriving business. Here’s why.', 'Most people think success requires 16-hour days. Typically, the opposite is true. Busy and effective are not the same thing — even though “busyness” has become a modern-day status symbol.', '“Hustle might move you forward, but it doesn’t set you up for sustainable success,” says Kyle Young, author of QuitterProof. “Good habits are formed through consistency and repetition, not mindless effort.”', 'Many of the world’s greatest innovators (past and present) dedicated large amounts of time to simply thinking. Reflecting. Strategizing and planning. Bill Gates originally made the Think Week famous. Now, other founders, like Skillshare’s Mike Karnjanaprakorn, have adopted this practice. Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Ferrriss have also followed suit.', 'Taking a digital sabbath can also keep you feeling rested and ready to play the long game. On Saturday, Sunday or another day of your choice, avoid technology in all forms. For example, power down your laptop and place it safely out of sight. Shut off your smartphone and hide it in a drawer. Change your Netflix password — and then try to forget it. Give your brain the gift of peace, and the time to reflect and generate new ideas.', '51: That’s how many games Mikael and Niklas Hed created before they launched Angry Birds , which saved their company, Rovio, from bankruptcy.', '25: That’s how many publishers rejected Tim Ferriss’ The Four-Hour Workweek before Harmony Books offered him a contract.

Often, lots of time. A sustainable business model gives you the freedom to enjoy the ride. You can focus on building something you love, and that truly serves your customers, instead of racing toward empty growth targets.', '“So, what’s your exit strategy?”', 'Entrepreneurs often hear this question before they’ve earned a single dollar — and it can be disorienting. When you’re still building a business you love, why would you think about selling it?', 'Just as there are marked differences between bootstrapped and VC-backed founders, “exit strategies” often divide entrepreneurs into two camps: those building to sell, and those who are in it for the long run.', 'Either scenario has merit. Business is personal, and we all need to make our own choices. Although some bootstrappers will eventually sell their firms, they rarely begin with this goal in mind.', '“What’s better than an exit strategy?” says Todoist founder Amir Salihefendic. “It’s a long-term mission that your company truly cares about. It’s focusing on building a company that can outlast you and creating something of true value.”', 'Create value first and valuation will follow. Bootstrapping forces you to develop a product that’s worth paying for instead of trying to reach the top of TechCrunch or building a house of cards on a shaky foundation.', 'As I mentioned in Building my startup for 12 years: how to win the long game , you can retain your values, freedom and flexibility. You can learn from a slow-burning journey. You can focus on the long-term rather than the short.', 'A study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that unicorns (private companies valued above $1 billion) are roughly 50% overvalued. They’re not generating billions of dollars in revenue, but thanks to deep-pocketed investments, paper valuations swell to reach that 10-figure sum.', 'Relying purely on estimates can be risky, because a sky-high valuation demands rapid scaling. And if the sky suddenly falls, VC-backed startups are often left in a vulnerable position. As Warren Buffet once said, “It’s only when the tide goes out that you can see who’s been swimming naked.”', 'The media may glorify fast movers and big wins, but playing the long game is another type of victory. In fact, slow growth doesn’t have to be a mere consequence of bootstrapping; it can be a smart, deliberate choice.', 'If you measure success against lofty goals, it’s easy to feel discouraged along the way and devastated if you don’t reach them at all. Instead, each new milestone can be something to celebrate.', '“There is power in small wins and slow gains,” says James Clear. “This is why average speed yields above average results. This is why the system is greater than the goal.”', 'It’s worth exploring asking yourself:', 'For many bootstrappers, a harmonious work culture, plus total creative and financial freedom is the ultimate compensation.', 'In the hard-driving startup world, “culture” can be a cliché topic.

We keep normal hours and try to treat each other with deep respect.

But those “official” values didn’t save the company from a high-profile bankruptcy and auditing scandal that sent several top executives to prison.', 'Culture grows through big choices, like team structure, transparency, and product-focused goals. It also emerges through smaller actions, like when the founder preaches balance and leaves the office by 6 pm every night.', 'As you begin to grow and hire a team, here are five ways to encourage a rich, healthy startup culture:', 'Bootstrapping is just one way to build a business. Capital-intensive industries such as energy, transportation, telecommunications, and brick-and-mortar stores and restaurants often require funding. VC backing might also be the best way to achieve your business goals and personal ambitions.', 'For anyone who’s eager to control their entrepreneurial destiny, bootstrapping can be an excellent choice. It worked for me, and I hope it can work for you, too.', 'Yes, it takes patience, drive, and determination.

You can grow at a sane pace and maintain a healthy personal life.', 'A self-funded business can also achieve great financial success. It might take more time, but the journey is often far more enjoyable. You can develop a product that improves people’s lives and build a top-notch team to help you along the way.

They help people approach their own views with more humility, doubt, and curiosity.”', 'The result is that “when people have a chance to express themselves out loud, they often discover new thoughts.”', 'Only once you’ve established a trusting relationship is it time to engage in a dialogue about change. Even then, it’s not about pressuring the other person to accept your views. Instead, it’s about having an empathetic and non-judgemental discussion that affirms the person’s desire and ability to change.', 'In the book, Grant shares a series of motivational interviewing experiments. The findings showed that those who engaged in motivational interviewing “felt less pressure to avoid contradictions in their thinking, which encouraged them to explore their opinions more deeply, recognize more nuances in them, and share them more openly.”', 'The thing is that whether we agree with someone’s decision or not, their decision is just that — it’s theirs.', 'We’re there to help them explore their opinions more deeply, free from judgment, while simultaneously affirming our confidence in their ability to make an informed decision without our stamp of approval.', 'My style of influencing others has never been about being right.

Oprah Winfrey does the same: she starts each day with her gratitude journal, noting five things for which she’s thankful.', 'Billionaire entrepreneur and investor Reid Hoffman asks himself questions about his thinking before bed: What are the kind of key things that might be constraints on a solution, or might be the attributes of a solution? What are the tools or assets I might have? What are the key things that I want to think about? What do I want to solve creatively? Grandmaster chess player and world champion martial artist Josh Waitzkin has a similar process, “My journaling system is based around studying complexity. Reducing the complexity down to what is the most important question. Sleeping on it, and then waking up in the morning first thing and pre-input brainstorming on it. So I’m feeding my unconscious material to work on, releasing it completely, and then opening my mind and riffing on it.”', 'Whenever legendary management consultant Peter Drucker made a decision, he wrote down what he expected to happen; several months later, he’d compare the results with his expectations.

Former President John Adams kept over 51 journals throughout his life.', 'Ever notice that after writing about your thoughts, plans, and experiences, you feel clearer and more focused? Researchers call this “writing to learn.” It helps us bring order and meaning to our experiences and becomes a potent tool for knowledge and discovery. It also augments our ability to think about complex topics that have dozens of interrelated parts, while our brain, by itself, can only manage three in any given moment.

Thomas Edison napped for up to three hours per day. Winston Churchill considered his late afternoon nap non-negotiable. John F. Kennedy ate his lunch in bed before drawing the curtains for a one- to two-hour nap.

Rockefeller (every day after lunch), Margaret Thatcher (one hour a day), Arnold Schwarzenegger (every afternoon), and Bill Clinton (15–60 minutes a day).', 'Modern science confirms that napping makes us not only more productive, but also more creative. Maybe that’s why greats such as Salvador Dali, chess grandmaster Josh Waitzkin, and Edgar Allen Poe used naps to induce hypnagogia, a state of awareness between sleep and wakefulness that helped them access a deeper level of creativity.', 'Top performers also build exercise into their daily routine. The most common form is walking.', 'Charles Darwin went on two walks daily: one at noon and one at 4 p.m. After a midday meal, Beethoven embarked on a long, vigorous walk, carrying a pencil and sheets of music paper to record chance musical thoughts. Charles Dickens walked a dozen miles a day and found writing so mentally agitating that he once wrote, “If I couldn’t walk fast and far, I should just explode and perish.” Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche concluded, “It is only ideas gained from walking that have any worth.”', 'Others who made a habit of walking include Gandhi (took a long walk every day), Jack Dorsey (takes a five-mile walk each morning), Steve Jobs (took a long walk when he had a serious talk), Tory Burch (45 minutes a day), Howard Schultz (walks every morning), Aristotle (gave lectures while walking), neurologist and author Oliver Sacks (walked after lunch), and Winston Churchill (walked every morning upon waking).', 'Now we have scientific data proving what these geniuses intuited: taking a walk refreshes the mind and body, and increases creativity.

Francis Crick and James Watson, the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, batted ideas back and forth relentlessly, both in their shared office and during daily lunches in Cambridge. Crick recalled that if he presented a flawed idea, “Watson would tell me in no uncertain terms this was nonsense, and vice-versa.” Artists Andy Warhol and Pat Hackett took two hours each morning to “do the diary” together: recounting the previous day’s activities in detail.', 'Many greats made a habit of conversing in large, ritualized groups. Theodore Roosevelt’s “Tennis Cabinet” included friends and diplomats who exercised together daily and debated the issues facing the country. Benjamin Franklin created a “mutual improvement society” called the Junto that gathered each Friday evening to learn from each other. The Vagabonds were a group of four famous friends — Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Harvey Firestone, and John Burroughs — who took road trips each summer: camping, climbing, and “sitting around the campfire discussing their various scientific and business ventures and debating the pressing issues of the day.”', 'There’s a reason that Jeff Bezos says, “Our success at Amazon is a function of how many experiments we do per year, per month, per week, per day…”', 'One big winner pays for all of the losing experiments.

We all know that if you swing for the fences, you’re going to strike out a lot, but you’re also going to hit some home runs. The difference between baseball and business, however, is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution. When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four. In business, every once in awhile, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs.”', 'No matter how much you read and discuss, you’re still going to have to spend some time making your own mistakes. If that discourages you, just remember Thomas Edison. It took him more than 50,000 botched experiments to invent the alkaline storage cell battery, and 9,000 to perfect the light bulb. But at his death, he held nearly 1,100 U.S. patents.', 'Experiments don’t just happen in the “real” world. Our brain has an incredible ability to simulate reality and explore possibilities at a much faster rate and lower cost. Einstein used thought experiments (imagining himself chasing a light beam through space, for instance) to help construct breakthrough scientific theories; you can use them to set your imagination free on slightly smaller conundrums. The journals of Thomas Edison, Leonardo da Vinci, and other luminaries aren’t just filled with writing, they’re also filled with sketches and mind maps.', 'Standup comedy is a far cry from inventing, but experimentation is just as key in the arts as it is in science.

Rock prepares for huge shows in venues such as Madison Square Garden by piecing his routine together in small clubs for months on end, trying out new material and getting instant feedback from audiences (they either laugh or they don’t).', 'Others use experiments to force them to take on new habits or break unhealthy ones. Iconic producer and writer Shonda Rhimes decided to take on her workaholism and extreme introversion and say yes to everything that scared her in an experiment she called the Year of Yes. Jia Jang confronted the universal fear of rejection with his 100 Days of Rejection project, which he then catalogued on YouTube.

It turned out that the materials cost of a rocket was around two percent of the typical price.”', 'Instead of buying a rocket for millions of dollars, Musk decided to purchase the raw materials for cheap and build the rockets himself in his own company.', 'And SpaceX was born.', 'Reasoning from first principles forces you to think differently. First Principles is about getting to the root cause of the problem. You have to break down the problem into its basic elements.', 'There are three main steps to apply this thinking framework:', 'If you want a deeper look into Musk’s mind and reasoning by first principles, read one of my all-time favorite articles: The Cook and the Chef: Musk’s Secret Sauce.', 'The first productivity hack gave you a slight hint for this one: Musk prefers to communicate on his own terms. That means defaulting to email and texts, both asynchronous ways of communication.', 'In his own words:', '“I do love email. Wherever possible I try to communicate asynchronously. I’m really good at email.”', 'He also makes himself hard to reach for people outside his company by using an obscure email address.', 'This lets him focus on actual work for his companies.', 'Progress comes from being focused and performing Deep Work. This means living as asynchronously as possible and with minimal interruptions from coworkers.', 'Here are three solutions to start working on your terms (in order of difficulty):', 'Minimize distractions in your daily life in order to make progress in meaningful work.', 'When Musk is not building rockets or revolutionizing the automobile industry, there’s one place you can always find him: on email. He joked at a conference: “I do a lot of email — very good at email. That’s my core competency”.', 'He is extremely clear, concise, and direct on his emails. As an example, read the email sent to his entire staff about the use of acronyms aptly called “Acronyms Seriously Suck”.', 'He frequently emails his entire company with updates, how to communicate, company visions and mission, and being more productive at work.', '“People work better when they know what the goal is and why. It is important that people look forward to coming to work in the morning and enjoy working.”', 'He is also a master at public speaking, converting complex concepts into easy to understand language using an authentic voice. Musk often uses the present tense when talking about visionary topics, a language trick that excites the listener into feeling the future is now.', 'According to a study of Carleton University, a third of the workweek of the “typical’’ knowledge worker is spent on email. That’s why mastering communication over email is an art form.', 'You want to be succinct but also get your message across. In an email, every word counts. Here are some tips on how to master communication over email:', 'Musk multi-tasks strategically. Whenever possible, he combines several tasks together in a productivity hack known as batching. For example, he answers emails while eating or having a meeting over lunch.', 'Here’s a quote from Elon on the subject:', '“But what I find is I’m able to be with [my kids] and still be on email. I can be with them and still be working at the same time… If I didn’t, I wouldn’t be able to get my job done.”', 'Another example is going through emails and invoices while on phone meetings or interviews.', 'Studies have confirmed that multi-tasking is normally less efficient than single-tasking. The brain needs time to adjust when navigating different tasks, also known as task switching. Switching makes you tired and unproductive, not the tasks themselves.', 'But if you batch similar tasks that call for similar mindsets you can efficiently work on multiple tasks without losing your workflow. In other words, your brain is focused on one type of task at a time.', 'Here are a couple of examples:', 'To find more activities you can stack, write down all your general activities for the day and week and identify the ones that can be batched together. Try the batch a couple of times and rearrange tasks if necessary.', 'To process batches even faster, use the Pomodoro Technique.', 'Running three companies is no small feat, which means time is of the essence for Elon Musk. He is constantly trying to optimize his time using feedback loops.', 'Like many other ultra-productive and successful people, he follows a very detailed and specific daily schedule. He breaks his calendar into five-minute slots and finding your way into one of those openings is tough work.', 'He prioritizes engineering, design, and manufacturing, spending 80 percent of his time at work on those areas.', '“I don’t spend my time pontificating about high-concept things; I spend my time solving engineering and manufacturing problems.”', 'By splitting his day into 5-minute chunks, Musk manages to get more tasks scheduled into his work.', 'The most productive people work from their calendar instead of a to-do list. Calendars are finite and give you a better sense of time, making it easier to determine how much time you have to complete projects during your week.', 'Breaking your days into small chunks and scheduling tasks on your calendar can boost your productivity. But you don’t have to use 5-minute chunks. I found that the most efficient way of organizing my work is to break the days into 30-minute slots. Find a timing that works best for you and your work.', 'And make sure that you schedule everything: checking email, calling clients, lunch, and meetings. Everything goes on your calendar.', 'Rip to-do lists and instead work from your calendar.', 'Perhaps one of Musk’s most notorious character traits is his tendency to set incredibly ambitious deadlines for his companies’ projects. He uses stretch goals as a way to change perception:', '“The first step is to establish that something is possible; then probability will occur.”', 'Here’s a story from a former SpaceX executive: “It’s like he has everyone working on this car that is meant to get from Los Angeles to New York on one tank of gas. They will work on the car for a year and test all of its parts. Then, when they set off for New York after that year, all the vice presidents think privately that the car will be lucky to get to Las Vegas. What ends up happening is that the car gets to New Mexico — twice as far as they ever expected — and Elon is still mad. He gets twice as much as anyone else out of people.” (emphasis mine)', 'The last sentence illustrates the power of stretch goals. Even in the face of failure, your goal was so outrageous, so impossible to achieve, that you celebrate the small achievements you made because you expected that nothing would come out of it.', 'The initial plan of Tesla was to start shipping the Roadster in 2006. The company pushed that deadline back several times until the car actually became available in 2008. Even though they released its car almost two years after the deadline, Tesla delivered the first completely battery-powered electric car.', 'In his own words:', '“I say something, and then it usually happens. Maybe not on schedule, but it usually happens.”', 'Musk’s stretch goals have given us a world where one of the best cars you can buy is electric, and where we finally have reusable rockets: “When Henry Ford made cheap, reliable cars, people said, ‘Nah, what’s wrong with a horse?’ That was a huge bet he made, and it worked.”', 'Setting goals that maintain the status quo doesn’t get you reusable rockets.', 'The intention of setting stretch goals is to push yourself outside the comfort zone. Growth doesn’t happen when you keep doing what you’ve already done in the past. It comes from failing while trying to make progress. If you aim to achieve five great things and only succeed at two of them, you are outperforming all the people who never tried in the first place.', 'Stretch goals demand more quantity and quality of work and force you to innovate more often than ordinary goals. And in the pursuit of it, you grow your skills to where they need to be in order to get it done.', 'At first, you won’t know how ambitious your stretch goals should be. Using trial and error, understand how much past your limits you should push. But the most important thing is to start trying and then adjust as you go.', 'Next time you are making plans for work, take a few extra minutes to include a stretch goal. Try to push yourself to perform 50% better than your normal goal requires. Go big and see if you can surprise yourself with incredible performance. Using this strategy is the first step towards smashing goals and reaching targets you didn’t even think were possible!', 'In 2004, Musk called a supplier to get the price of an electromechanical actuator. The supplier quoted $120,000.', 'Reasoning from first principles, Musk broke down the components needed and asked Steve Davis, now SpaceX’s director of advanced projects, to build one from scratch for under $5,000. Davis spent nine months designing and building the actuator for $3,900, which flew to space inside the Falcon 1 rocket.', 'Elon Musk is never satisfied with where he is now. His companies have had enormous achievements, but Musk knows that there’s always room for improvement — in every area. There’s always a better, faster, or cheaper way to do things:', '“You should take the approach that you’re wrong. Your goal is to be less wrong.”', 'This is what is called a growth mindset, an important skill that separates successful people from everyone else. When you have a growth mindset, you know you can learn anything if you put enough effort into it. And if you fail, you approach the problem from a different angle until you find a solution that works. You iterate until you get it right.', 'In Musk’s words:', '“Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough.”', 'The opposite is known as a fixed mindset, where the status quo is rarely challenged. Things will always be the way they are because “that’s how we do things around here”. Preconceived notions are taken as universal truths, instead of being questioned. Thus, people stagnate.', 'On the other hand, developing a growth-oriented mindset brings progress to both our personal and professional lives. And even if you manage small gains each day are small, they compound over time. A 1% gain every day compounds to almost 3800% increase over a year.', 'Growth comes from tackling difficult problems, questions, and challenges. In order to succeed, you need to train the brain to look at failures and struggles as progress, as getting closer to the solution.', 'Here’s how you can start developing a growth mindset:', 'According to his brother, Musk used to read 2 books a day from an early age. In other words: he devoured knowledge. This led to a wide understanding of many sciences, such as physics, math, engineering, and computer science.', 'One of my favorite quotes is about how he describes knowledge:', '“It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree — make sure you understand the fundamental principles, ie the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.”', 'Even when running his companies, Musk constantly tries to learn from the people around him that have more knowledge on a specific topic. Here’s a passage from the book: “He would trap an engineer in the SpaceX factory and set to work grilling him about a type of valve or specialized material. “I thought at first that he was challenging me to see if I knew my stuff,” said Kevin Brogan, one of the early engineers. “Then I realized he was trying to learn things. He would quiz you until he learned ninety percent of what you know.”', 'Over the years, Musk developed T-shaped skills: a lot of knowledge in one particular field and a substantial amount of knowledge in many other disciplines and topics. This allowed him to be world-class in one field (business) but also use his broad knowledge to innovate, find different solutions, be more creative, and collaborate with experts in other fields effectively.', 'Let’s start with a practical example: you want to be healthy. In order to be healthy, practicing just one sport isn’t going to cut it. You need to know a whole lot of skills: you need to learn the basics of a good diet, how to develop muscle, flexibility, different cardio, condition, etc. While you have deep knowledge in a particular field — the sport — , you also developed broad knowledge in many other areas which are the basis on being healthy. This is the T-shaped skills approach.', 'Let’s look at someone who works in Marketing or Growth: deep knowledge in acquisition channels such as PPC, SEO, and viral loops, while also having broad knowledge over other topics such as statistics, some programming, design principles, and copywriting.', 'Here’s how you can develop T-shaped skills in your area:', 'One of the most upvoted questions on the 2015 Reddit AMA with Musk was:“What daily habit do you believe has the largest positive impact on your life?” To which Musk simply replied: “Showering.”', 'In another interview, Musk admitted the shower is where he normally comes up with the best ideas: “This sounds really cliche, but like, the shower is probably like the most… wake up, go shower in the morning and I think so what’s really happened is things have percolated in the subconscious and it’s not really occurring in the shower but you’re kinda getting the results from last night’s you know, computation, basically.” (emphasis mine)', 'I think that’s the lesson in productivity from showering: your brain has been working all night for you, trying to come up with solutions in the background. It takes a few minutes to turn “on” and that can happen during the shower, helping you see challenges with more clarity.', 'It also provides you with quiet time to think right after refreshing your brain. You can use it to plan the day ahead or think about solutions for problems you might face during the day ahead, for example.', '“I think it is possible for ordinary people to choose to be extraordinary.”', 'Stay blessed, and stay inspired!', 'If you are looking for more productivity hacks, join my invite-only community: one new short curated productivity hack to your email, twice a week → get FREE access!']"
