\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you know about war?
They\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you it\xe2\x80\x99s about
patriotism, democracy
or some shit about the other guy
hating our freedom.
But you want to know
what it\xe2\x80\x99s really about?
What do you see?
A kid from Arkansas
doing his patriotic duty
to defend his country?
I see a helmet, fire-retardant gloves,
body armor, and an M16. I see $17,500.
That\xe2\x80\x99s what it costs to outfit
one American soldier.
Over two million soldiers
fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.
It cost the American taxpayer
$4.5B ($4,500,000,000) each year
just to pay the air conditioning bills
for those wars. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what
war is really about.
WAR IS AN ECONOMY.
Anybody who tells you otherwise
is either in on it or stupid.
But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that yet.
Back then, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything.\xe2\x80\x9d

1. Recommend this story. It helps others see the story, lets me know my work is worth writing, reading and recommending and makes me feel validated and fuzzy, because honestly, whose cold, dead heart isn\xe2\x80\x99t instantly thawed and revived by the dizzying dopamine of notifications? Like, share, retweet, lather, rinse, repeat. Also, the doctors say if I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel fuzzy, I\xe2\x80\x99ll die, due to a rare deficiency in social currency triggered whenever my Klout score drops below 70. It\xe2\x80\x99s 67 right now. Not a good look. Do you want me to die?! Didn\xe2\x80\x99t think so.
