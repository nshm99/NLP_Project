\xe2\x80\xa6as the day Eric Garner was killed on July 17, 2014, the day Michael Brown Jr. was killed on August 9, 2014, the day Tamir Rice was killed on November 22, 2014, the day Walter Scott was killed on April 4, 2015, the day Freddie Gray was killed on April 19, 2015.
No one at my job said anything. Through all those senseless and horrific deaths of Black men and children at the hands of White police officers, not one person at my job said anything about it. Not one person at my job was Black either.
A few years have passed since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been at that company, but I have never forgotten that feeling; the feeling of being utterly distraught, yet so completely alone in my sadness.
Last night, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep. I stayed up writing a piece about the first time a White person at work actually acknowledged our long-standing American tragedy of racism, bigotry, and injustice. That first time was this week.
I am a Black woman.
Not only that, I am a Black woman working in tech, one of the most homogeneous industries ever birthed.
As a woman in tech, I account for 30% of the tech workforce.
As a Black person in tech, I account for 5% of the tech workforce.
I currently work at a venture capital firm that invests in tech startups. Our VC firm is arguably the most diverse in the country with 5 Blacks, 2 Latinx, 2 Whites, and 4 women. Just to put that in perspective, venture capital firms are 97% White and Asian and 89% men, so yeah, we\xe2\x80\x99re really really diverse in comparison.
When I went into work yesterday, the first thing my boss, who is a White woman, mentioned to me was the anger and pain she was feeling about the fatal shootings of two more Black men by White police officers.
She talked about the articles she read and the videos she watched and how she wanted to say something about it to the crowd of Silicon Valley founders and investors we\xe2\x80\x99d be gathering for an event later that evening. She took the time to ask me how I was doing and if I wanted to talk or take some time off. She was in all ways very supportive and proactively so.
I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I realized it at the time. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until I actually sat down to write this piece, in fact, that the significance of that short interaction really sunk in for me.
A White person.
Better yet, my boss.
At work.
Initiated a conversation with me about racial injustice in America.
She expressed disgust and outrage.
She asked if I was OK.
She offered to speak out.
She planned to take action.
How many of my Black brothers and sisters \xe2\x80\x94 especially in tech \xe2\x80\x94 can say that their White colleagues acknowledge the current state of racial injustice in America?
Seriously, I want to know. In fact, leave a comment on this post, so we can all know. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been in tech that long \xe2\x80\x94 five years now \xe2\x80\x94 but I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you one thing for sure:
And why? Well because\xe2\x80\xa6
And because tech does not interact with Black people at work or at home\xe2\x80\xa6
So yesterday, when my boss \xe2\x80\x94 a White woman in tech \xe2\x80\x94 empathized with me, a Black woman, that was A.VERY.BIG.DEAL. In fact, it was the first time a White colleague (and I\xe2\x80\x99ve had many) has ever said anything to me about the killing of a Black person in America by a White police officer \xe2\x80\x94 and there\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunately been several opportunities for them to speak up.
The fact that a White colleague in a work setting made it a point to make a point about racial injustice in America and acknowledge the Black community\xe2\x80\x99s pain, hurt, and anger over it\xe2\x80\xa6the fact that she didn\xe2\x80\x99t just act like today was \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness as usual\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 that meant more to me than any free lunches, office perks, or holiday bonuses ever could.
That means something.
So I\xe2\x80\x99m going to say this to all my White brothers and sisters working alongside my Black brothers and sisters:
Here\xe2\x80\x99s how\xe2\x80\xa6
Don\xe2\x80\x99t wait for a/the Black person at your company to say something. Don\xe2\x80\x99t wait for your HR or ERG rep to send you an email. Take it upon yourself to get educated about the Do\xe2\x80\x99s and Don\xe2\x80\x99ts of being a good ally.
You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to have all the right words or all the perfect answers, but just saying something to the Black and White people you work with \xe2\x80\x94 acknowledging that this atrocity happened and that you\xe2\x80\x99re hurt by it \xe2\x80\x94 that really is a start to making a difference. Speak about the humanity of those innocent Black men, speak about the mourning of the Black community and our entire country. Just whatever you do, speak from the heart.
What\xe2\x80\x99s happening to Black people under police patrol is a national tragedy, and it is having a traumatizing effect on many people. Don\xe2\x80\x99t expect your Black colleagues to be able to jump right back into work as if nothing\xe2\x80\x99s happened\xe2\x80\x94 especially if they\xe2\x80\x99re in a workplace that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even acknowledge these horrific events are taking place.
Tech is smart \xe2\x80\x94 like really freakin\xe2\x80\x99 smart. Tech wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be taking over the world if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so damn smart. So I don\xe2\x80\x99t buy the \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do\xe2\x80\x9d spiel. You have a growth mindset when it comes to everything else. Why do your critical thinking skills suddenly vanish when it comes to figuring out how you can contribute to this whole racial equality thing? Whether it be investing in a more diverse workforce, lobbying for judicial system reform, refusing to do business with cities and individuals that perpetrate racism\xe2\x80\xa6there are countless things you can take action on. I wholeheartedly believe that if you put your minds, hearts, and resource$ together, you can devise solutions in collaboration with the grassroots movements already on the ground and help write a new, more promising chapter of race relations in America.
Each of us has a part to play in creating the workplace and world that sees the humanity and value in all people. Each of us has a part to play in creating an environment where all people can *live* with dignity and respect. To accomplish this, it\xe2\x80\x99s vital that you do some retrospection and reflection and ask yourself: What am I doing today to be a part of the solution? What will I do tomorrow to be a part of the solution? What will I do next week? Next month? Next year?\xe2\x80\xa6
We must never stop looking in the mirror, for it\xe2\x80\x99s the only way we can truly ensure we bring about the change we wish to see.
