For the past few days, I\xe2\x80\x99ve watched female friend after female friend post the same update.
#MeToo.
Each update has seen these brave women opening up candidly and honestly about the abuse they\xe2\x80\x99ve suffered at the hands of men.
From unwanted advances to violent assault and rape, and every shitty experience in-between, it\xe2\x80\x99s been a sobering and raw thing to watch unfold, and my heart aches for each and every one of my friends, and their friends, and all the friends of friends I do not know, yet share a common enemy.
Men.
Because let\xe2\x80\x99s face it, there\xe2\x80\x99s only one common denominator in all of this, and that\xe2\x80\x99s men who feel so entitled that women are little more than a plaything to toy with when the moment takes.
And the only people who can really change this mindset are the ones who are responsible for it, either through inaction, complicity, silent knowledge, or \xe2\x80\x94 like me \xe2\x80\x94 past mistakes that we don\xe2\x80\x99t see as mistakes until it\xe2\x80\x99s too late.
How many times have you heard that? Or variations of it?
Boys will be boys. He\xe2\x80\x99s just finding his way. He\xe2\x80\x99s just learning about hormones and what it is to be a man.
Too many, I\xe2\x80\x99d wager. Far too many. As a woman, I bet you\xe2\x80\x99re sick and fucking tired of that shitty excuse being paraded every single time a guy gets caught with his hands where they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be.
As a guy, I can pretty much guarantee you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that as an excuse for your indiscretions. Hell, I bet you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it so often, from people who should know better, that it became your stock defence.
Except it\xe2\x80\x99s not a defence. It\xe2\x80\x99s not okay.
And it\xe2\x80\x99s not an acceptable excuse for your shitty behaviour.
When I was 13, maybe 14, I heard that a few times from my stepdad. We lived on a council estate in the Scottish borders, and come the evenings after school, or the weekends in-between, me and my friends would hang out and try and impress girls with our bravado.
Riding bikes with no hands, hanging off the monkey bars with one foot, etc. All good fun, all harmless flirting \xe2\x80\x94 until it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.
When the girls didn\xe2\x80\x99t show interest, we\xe2\x80\x99d chase them. We\xe2\x80\x99d laugh, and they\xe2\x80\x99d laugh, and it was fun.
Until it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.
Until we \xe2\x80\x94 a group of four boys \xe2\x80\x94 caught up with one of the girls, and we\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x9ccop a feel\xe2\x80\x9d. We\xe2\x80\x99d hug them, and kiss their cheeks, and say \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re our girlfriend now!\xe2\x80\x9d
And everyone would laugh. Except, really, only the boys would genuinely laugh. Sure, the girl would laugh too, but it was different.
A laugh that said everything:
I\xe2\x80\x99m playing along, because that\xe2\x80\x99s all I can really do, but this is not OK.
THIS IS NOT OK.
And, of course, we were excused by our dads/stepdads/men in our lives, and told it\xe2\x80\x99s just for fun and part of growing up.
It\xe2\x80\x99s just what boys do.
BUT IT\xe2\x80\x99S FUCKING NOT, AND IT NEVER SHOULD BE!
When did we decide that? How did we get to the point where for boys, it\xe2\x80\x99s just part of growing up, but for girls, well, clearly they were asking for it?
And why did no-one speak up and say it was wrong?
It was only after I was talking to one of the girls that played in the park alongside us, a few weeks after our game of \xe2\x80\x9cchase\xe2\x80\x9d, that the truth came out.
How she was terrified. Not just of us, but of what she\xe2\x80\x99d be called at home if her dad found out.
Because, yes, boys will just be boys, but a daughter becomes a slut because she\xe2\x80\x99s the one that got caught by the pack?
Fuck. That. Shit.
I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t thought of that time as a teen until this week, and all the #MeToo examples came crashing through like a hurricane of pain.
Because, truth be told, I \xe2\x80\x94 along with my friends that summer \xe2\x80\x94 had been conditioned to believe we were just having fun.
It\xe2\x80\x99s not real if no-one gets hurt, right?
Except it is real and the victim always gets hurt. ALWAYS.
Do you honestly believe no-one gets hurt when you\xe2\x80\x99re in their space, in their face, in their safe zone, and you\xe2\x80\x99re laughing while there, because that\xe2\x80\x99s just \xe2\x80\x9cboys having fun\xe2\x80\x9d??
If you do, you\xe2\x80\x99re a fucking moron. I know, because I was that moron.
It took a girl I\xe2\x80\x99d chased and made truly afraid to show me that. How can that be correct?
How can the person we pain need to be the one that shows us it\xe2\x80\x99s not right? Not acceptable? Not \xe2\x80\x9cfun\xe2\x80\x9d?
Simple \xe2\x80\x94 it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be. Because it\xe2\x80\x99s not their job to.
It\xe2\x80\x99s ours, as so-called \xe2\x80\x9cmen\xe2\x80\x9d, to do. And not just today, and not just for us.
But every day, for every man, to teach every boy as well as each other, that this can never be right. This can never be excused away as just boys being boys.
Because when was the last time you heard \xe2\x80\x9coh, that\xe2\x80\x99s just girls being girls, who cares if they\xe2\x80\x99re grabbing that boy\xe2\x80\x99s crotch\xe2\x80\x9d?
Exactly.
So.
We have a choice. We can look at ourselves, and admit we were part of the problem (and still are, if we remain silent) and speak up about it, and fix it, and support women that are still going through it, every single day.
Or, we can remain silent, safe in the belief that we were never \xe2\x80\x9clike that\xe2\x80\x9d.
Except, if you take the latter choice, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to call you out on it as a liar.
Because, much like almost 100% of my female friends\xe2\x80\x99 feed has a #MeToo example, I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to bet that almost 100% of my male friends has been responsible for that at some point in their life.
And if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t, if you truly haven\xe2\x80\x99t, I salute you, and hope you pass that on to your kids, your male friends, your male peers. Because you are truly one of the very few men who has never mistreated a woman friend, lover, peer, in some form or other.
For the rest of us? Don\xe2\x80\x99t stay silent. Speak up, apologize, and fix this shit, starting today.
Teach our sons about respect, and restraint, and the fact that no means no, with absolutely zero wiggle room. And teach them about equality and being the kind of man that stands against what is very clearly not okay.
And teach our daughters they do not have to dress a certain way, nor do they have to act a certain way, because that\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cjust what girls are meant to do\xe2\x80\x9d.
Teach that, and more. And teach it daily. Until one day, we don\xe2\x80\x99t need to draw up lesson plans like this, because it should have been common fucking sense from the start.
It\xe2\x80\x99s the very least the better half of this planet deserve.
