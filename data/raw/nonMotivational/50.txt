If this is the age of victimhood, then there are no larger (and more recognised) victim groups than gender and racial minorities.
My race (and certain other traits) put me firmly in the \xe2\x80\x9cvictim minority\xe2\x80\x9d bracket\xe2\x80\x94well, if you ignore the horribleness of my maleness. I should clarify that I don\xe2\x80\x99t see myself in those terms. But so strong is the wave of desire to identify and deify victims, that *some* people in everyday life insist on interacting with me as a member of a victim class. They mean well.
I\xe2\x80\x99ve resorted to spending more time than I\xe2\x80\x99d like thinking about these terms\xe2\x80\x94if only so I can find ways of ridding myself of them. And I have found a couple.
But of all the illogicalities that have emerged from the degeneration of political (and politicised) discourse, the biggest one (to me) is the exaltation of subjectivity.
This is the idea that an individual\xe2\x80\x99s feelings on matters with universal consequences, are more important than the construction of universally comprehensible and verifiable standards.
This is the biggest illogicality because it imposes the expectation that everyone, everywhere should get along and hold hands\xe2\x80\xa6 while assaulting, in sadomasochistic fashion, the only mechanism which can allow them to do so\xe2\x80\x94objectivity.
This is not just a conceptual problem and I\xe2\x80\x99ll illustrate that with a practical example.
Everywhere I look, I see stats about how there are either too many black people or too few of us in whatever state of existence we\xe2\x80\x99ve decided is topical. There are stats about how few women there are in STEM and a cherry-picked list of desirable professions. There\xe2\x80\x99s the inexplicably persistent gender pay gap narrative, which has been repeatedly debunked by such sexist publications as Harvard (a female professor at Harvard, to be specific) and Forbes (in an article written by another female academic).
And Thomas Sowell (a black economist) has been admonishing the western world since the 80s, about the inaccuracies (and dangerousness) of the way we dishonestly politicise disparities in income and opportunity, across race and gender. (You can watch the full 20-minute interview with Thomas Sowell here)
But I digress\xe2\x80\xa6 because I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a problem with these statistics, nor am I even here (solely) to debate their validity.
It\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x94humans\xe2\x80\x94do with these statistics that really bothers me. We abuse them with this new-found exaltation of subjectivity.
We turn victimhood into a mechanism for attaining disproportionately large power, then do what humans do best when we wield too much power\xe2\x80\x94abuse it.
So, we say, \xe2\x80\x9cMy subjective reality is that white people are racist and evil, therefore the fact there aren\xe2\x80\x99t more black CEOs *must be* the fault of white people.\xe2\x80\x9d
Or we say, \xe2\x80\x9cMy subjective reality is that all men are all evil, rapey gorillas, so the fact that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t more women in STEM *must be* the fault of men.\xe2\x80\x9d
Even ignoring that in all these conversations, never have I seen a causal chain constructed (let alone a causal link established)\xe2\x80\xa6 there\xe2\x80\x99s still a huge inconsistency in how these ideas evolve.
To prove that [INSERT MINORITY GROUP] would achieve a perfectly even 50/50 split of opportunities, were it not for the interference of [INSERT MAJORITY OPPRESSOR], we pretend there\xe2\x80\x99s perfect uniformity across groups.
We proclaim that gender and race are social constructs, completely removed from science and reality.
Women, men and people of different races are perfectly uniform in all abilities, interests and aptitudes. This is an incredibly subjective stance to take\xe2\x80\xa6 but let\xe2\x80\x99s entertain it for a minute.
If this were true, then there\xe2\x80\x99d be absolutely no need for diversity. If we are all uniform, then we are all interchangeable.
This is an exemplary case of mutual exclusivity. Either we are all different, therefore we need a good mix to capitalise on unique qualities\xe2\x80\xa6 or we\xe2\x80\x99re all the same, and each human possesses the same abilities to the same degree of competence as every other human.
If we acknowledge diversity, we *must* also acknowledge lack of uniformity. And if we acknowledge lack of uniformity, we *must* also acknowledge inequalities of ability.
The mistake we make is that our prejudices cause us to value some abilities more than others\xe2\x80\x94and we are simplistic enough to assume that being less skilled in these abilities makes people less valuable too.
For example, no one would bat an eyelid were I to suggest that the average height of Dutch people is greater than the average height of Senegalese people. But swap height for beauty, IQ or some other politically charged subject and the reaction completely changes\xe2\x80\x94because human prejudices cause us to assume \xe2\x80\x9cbeauty\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cIQ\xe2\x80\x9d are more valuable (or humanising) qualities than height.
This prejudice manifests itself in other unhealthy ways which I will cover later.
But I like to ask myself, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat if I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong?\xe2\x80\x9d So, I did and I could find only one potentially credible criticism.
That criticism is that diversity isn\xe2\x80\x99t about biological composition and abilities. It\xe2\x80\x99s about cultures and communal experiences, and how those shape individuals.
This is an idea I like\xe2\x80\xa6 but if this is the case, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we be encouraging people to fixate less on the artificial constructs of gender and race\xe2\x80\x94aka the \xe2\x80\x9cpatriarchy\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cwhite devil\xe2\x80\x9d? Both follow arbitrarily biological lines of categorisation and represent a hypocritical stance by those who claim things like race and gender shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be used to judge others. Surely, the shared experience of the human condition supersedes both? Surely, the lesson is that all humans (male or female, white or non-white, heterosexual or homosexual etc.) tend to abuse power when they wield too much of it?
If race and gender are social constructs, are the problems we see in the world not more likely to be borne of human nature\xe2\x80\x94rather than \xe2\x80\x9cwhite nature\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmale nature\xe2\x80\x9d or any other selectively defined nature?
And do the solutions to these problems not lie in our ability to find connections, based on shared human experiences and struggles, which traverse cultures and communities?
Yet, it was James Damore\xe2\x80\x99s position that women, as a group (not at an individual level) tend to have different interests from men, which got him fired. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t say the interests held by women are inferior to those held by men\xe2\x80\x94simply that they are different.
It\xe2\x80\x99s funny because firing James Damore seemed to me a highly \xe2\x80\x9cpatriarchal\xe2\x80\x9d move. It proved that Google believes the interests that are most likely to be held by men are more valuable than the interests that are more likely to be held by women. Therefore, the only way to argue that women (as a group) are as valuable as men is to argue that women are the same as men.
This is a sad conclusion because it encourages women to value themselves based on how identical they are to men.
This is symptomatic of a general move in society. We push groups identified as being marginalised to measure their value based on how identical they are to groups which are considered to be unfairly free of marginalisation.
Equality has been (wrongly) conflated with uniformity.
Similarly, Apple\xe2\x80\x99s diversity officer lost her job because she dared to suggest that a group of white men can still be diverse. Is whiteness so overpowering now, that it completely nullifies every other aspect of a person\xe2\x80\x99s existence? Their nationality? Their sexuality? Their socio-economic background? Their religious background? Their philosophical background?
In an age when we bemoan the paucity of women in top jobs at tech companies, should the expression of a logical opinion in a measured manner be a sackable offence? Especially for one of the few talented women (out of countless others) who\xe2\x80\x99s bucked the trend of female underrepresentation?
Subjectivity has been given such supremacy that the popular positions on gender and race are so riddled with inconsistencies that they suggest:
But why does this all matter\xe2\x80\x94why play this game of semantics?
Because there are real problems in the world, which need real solutions. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to shun political correctness and talk about those problems.
Incarceration rates among black people in western societies are high. Women are underrepresented in high-paying jobs (though this is not the same as a gender pay gap)\xe2\x80\x94and we mustn\xe2\x80\x99t forget that men are overrepresented in jobs where people are most likely to die. Rape is too high\xe2\x80\x94I won\xe2\x80\x99t quote stats because I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if there\xe2\x80\x99s one rape a year, that\xe2\x80\x99s still too many. Mental health problems take many lives every year\xe2\x80\x94especially men\xe2\x80\x99s. Young, working class, white men represent (arguably) the most economically under-privileged group in the UK.
And these are just a few of the problems we face.
Any good scientist (or problem solver) will tell you that to change an outcome, you must first accurately diagnose its cause. If you try to affect the wrong cause, you will not reverse the negative outcome.
This is why I\xe2\x80\x99m so opposed to the politicisation of these issues. When we politicise them, people stop looking for answers and start looking for scapegoats. Throw the exaltation of subjectivity into the mix and you get a recipe for obscurantism and ego tripping.
Meanwhile, people are still suffering the very real consequences of these problems.
This is not a game where the blacks win and the whites lose, or the women win and the men lose. It\xe2\x80\x99s a reality where we all win or lose together\xe2\x80\x94because there\xe2\x80\x99s only one Earth and we *all* have to share it.
It may well turn out, upon thorough investigation, that men and white people are to blame for 90% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s problems\xe2\x80\xa6 but we currently have no proof, just feelings. So, thorough investigation must come nonetheless.
Even in English criminal law, the condemnation of one person requires the accumulation of near-insurmountable evidence. You generally need actus reus (proof that a criminal act was committed) and mens rea (proof that the accused wilfully committed said criminal act). That means if I slip and accidentally knock a person dead, I can\xe2\x80\x99t be guilty of murder (there\xe2\x80\x99s no mens rea).
Yet, we so casually condemn entire groups of people?
And, to be clear, I have no political or social affiliations. This article does not exist to support one cause at the expense of the other. I think the left wing is just as full of shit as the right wing. I judge people on an individual-to-individual basis. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if you\xe2\x80\x99re white, black, straight, genderqueer, conservative, liberal, nationalistic or anarchistic\xe2\x80\x94if you show me kindness and openness, I will do the same.
But I find it funny that our desire for labels is so strong, we\xe2\x80\x99ve labelled those who disagree with the adoption of labels . They call us \xe2\x80\x9ccentrists\xe2\x80\x9d, as a slight\xe2\x80\xa6 people who are too spineless to \xe2\x80\x9cpick a side\xe2\x80\x9d, I guess. As if we\xe2\x80\x99re somehow in-between this stupid, unworkable idea and that other stupid, unworkable idea.
I\xe2\x80\x99m not a centrist. I\xe2\x80\x99m saying I\xe2\x80\x99m not even on the same spectrum. The damn thing is broken.
I\xe2\x80\x99m saying when you let go of the need to be right and focus on what the world needs to get right, you might see that the answer is no one has a good enough answer yet\xe2\x80\x94and we all need to keep looking. Hard.
*11 January 2018 Update*
I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten loads of responses and private messages to this article. 99% of them supportive\xe2\x80\x94unsurprisingly, the overwhelming majority from women and ethnic minorities.
But there\xe2\x80\x99s a small sect of people\xe2\x80\x94many of whom admit to not even reading the article\xe2\x80\x94who\xe2\x80\x99ve sent me abuse because \xe2\x80\x9cthis could only have come from a privileged white, male pig\xe2\x80\x9d. LOL.
Ironically, most of these people have been white men (I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but they just have been\xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why).
They assume there\xe2\x80\x99s no way I could be this rational and detached, if I had felt the punishing hand of discrimination in my life. They presume to know what all black people think and why they think it. If you need any more reasons why I don\xe2\x80\x99t want people deciding for me what I am or am not (and how I should or shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think), based on my race or gender, well here\xe2\x80\x99s another.
But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make this about me. Especially since two readers have left comments which express, in an educated and eloquent fashion, why it\xe2\x80\x99s logical to think the way I do\xe2\x80\xa6 particularly because I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived through discrimination.
Since race and gender apparently affect the validity of people thoughts\xe2\x80\xa6 and I\xe2\x80\x99m apparently not a real black person, I\xe2\x80\x99m trying something new. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a black man and a woman explaining why they too don\xe2\x80\x99t want gender or race to ever come into the equation\xe2\x80\x94whether for positive or negative discrimination.
