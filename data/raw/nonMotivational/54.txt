In recent days, multiple well-respected journalistic outlets have announced to much fanfare that, having reflected on the rapidly shifting American racial landscape, they will be capitalizing \xe2\x80\x9cBlack\xe2\x80\x9d as designations for people and cultures. Some have also clarified why they\xe2\x80\x99re not capitalizing \xe2\x80\x9cwhite.\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x9cBlack is an ethnic designation; white merely describes the skin color of people who can, usually without much difficulty, trace their ethnic origins back to a handful of European countries,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Mike Laws in the Columbia Journalism Review on June 16, before the article was updated with revised language. Dean Baquet and Phil Corbett of the New York Times wrote that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is less of a sense that \xe2\x80\x98white\xe2\x80\x99 describes a shared culture and history.\xe2\x80\x9d
Unfortunately, this choice runs the risk of reinforcing the dangerous myth that White people in America do not have a racial identity.
I haven\xe2\x80\x99t always capitalized \xe2\x80\x9cWhite\xe2\x80\x9d in my own writing, but I do now. Here\xe2\x80\x99s why.
Whiteness is not only an absence. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a hole in the map of America\xe2\x80\x99s racial landscape. Rather, it is a specific social category that confers identifiable and measurable social benefits. We were collectively reminded of that this past week, when Mark and Patricia McCloskey of St. Louis stood outside their home pointing loaded firearms directly at peaceful protestors making their way down the street. In that moment, the McCloskeys held the lives of strangers in their hands. They could have murdered any of those Black people that day, and history both distant and recent suggests that they may have been able to do so with total impunity.
When we ignore the specificity and significance of Whiteness \xe2\x80\x94 the things that it is, the things that it does \xe2\x80\x94 we contribute to its seeming neutrality and thereby grant it power to maintain its invisibility.
Meanwhile, Black people, from Tamir Rice to Darrien Hunt to John Crawford, and countless others whose names we may never know, have been murdered for holding, respectively, a toy gun, a fake sword used for cosplay, and a BB gun. Tamir Rice will never drive a car or go to college. Darrien Hunt will never attend another nerdy convention or watch anime again. John Crawford will never again hug his baby boys, Jayden and John Henry IV. The McCloskeys, who are personal injury trial lawyers, live on.
The stunning incongruousness of these facts \xe2\x80\x94 that a 12-year-old with a pellet gun would be murdered on sight in the same country where Mark McCloskey could stand openly in the street brandishing a semi-automatic rifle and his wife could point a pistol directly at passersby, rage contorting her face \xe2\x80\x94 rests not only on the Blackness of Rice, Hunt, and Crawford. It rests also on the Whiteness of the McCloskeys: the veneer of presumed innocence, respectability, and righteousness that protected them like a shield on that day. This shield ensconced their bodies, and their Renaissance-style palazzo, all of which remain intact and unsullied at the time of this writing. This shield protected Dylann Roof on his way to Burger King. It protected the still-unnamed woman who is seen in a recent viral video screaming at people and throwing food in Trader Joe\xe2\x80\x99s, who was unharmed though police were called in response to her behavior. It protects White children in public who are screaming or running or touching things they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t touch, while Black parents grasp their children tightly in fear that similar behavior could cost them their lives someday. It\xe2\x80\x99s a phenomenon all its own, something bigger than being not-Black or not-Indigenous or not-Asian.
Perhaps the only thing more remarkable than the powers of this shield is its seeming invisibility, which permits White people to move through the world without ever considering the fact of their Whiteness. This is an incredible feat, through which White people get to be only normal, neutral, or without any race at all, while the rest of us are saddled with this unpleasant business of being racialized.
I\xe2\x80\x99m reminded of the highly autonomous robots of the HBO series Westworld, which are programmed when they are faced with incontrovertible evidence that they are robots to reply simply, \xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like anything to me!\xe2\x80\x9d This is a great phrase to use next time an organization proudly tweets a photo of its all-White class of congressional interns, or television writers\xe2\x80\x99 room, or nonprofit board of directors. These people and organizations share such photos in a cloudy bliss, the shield surrounding them, protecting them from self-doubt or displeasure. When the rest of us raise the alarm, they squint at the photo, confused. \xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like anything to me!\xe2\x80\x9d And with that quick, easy magic, Whiteness remains invisible, and as is the case with all power structures, its invisibility does crucial work to maintain its power. In maintaining the pretense of its invisibility, Whiteness maintains the pretense of its inevitability, and its innocence. As long as White people do not ever have to interrogate what Whiteness is, where it comes from, how it operates, or what it does, they can maintain the fiction that race is other people\xe2\x80\x99s problem, that they are mere observers in a centuries-long stage play in which they have, in fact, been the producers, directors, and central actors.
Language and racial categories have some important things in common: They are fluid, they are inherently political, and they are a socially constructed set of shared norms that are constantly in flux as our beliefs and circumstances change.
Other than the demonstrably untrue idea that White \xe2\x80\x9cmerely\xe2\x80\x9d describes skin color, there are other interesting arguments to consider for keeping it lowercase. For instance, many Black people I know say that they capitalize Black as a show of respect, pride, and celebration, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to afford the same courtesy to Whiteness. But we frequently capitalize words for reasons other than respect \xe2\x80\x94 words like Holocaust, or Hell, which can be capitalized to indicate specificity or significance. When we ignore the specificity and significance of Whiteness \xe2\x80\x94 the things that it is, the things that it does \xe2\x80\x94 we contribute to its seeming neutrality and thereby grant it power to maintain its invisibility.
Some outlets have also noted that White supremacist hate groups capitalize White, so we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. To that, I respond with an ancient African American proverb: I ain\xe2\x80\x99t studdin\xe2\x80\x99 them.
Ultimately, it\xe2\x80\x99s good that we\xe2\x80\x99re having this public conversation. Plenty of other scholars who study race and racism will disagree with me on this, and that\xe2\x80\x99s fine. In fact, I disagree with myself from two years ago. In my own 2018 book, Ghosts in the Schoolyard, which is about schools and racism in my hometown of Chicago, I capitalized Black, but not White \xe2\x80\x94 a fact that an astute undergraduate student of mine noticed last year and asked me about, noting that my class slides now include a capital W. I told her that after thinking about it some more, I changed my mind. I might change my mind again. Language and racial categories have some important things in common: They are fluid, they are inherently political, and they are a socially constructed set of shared norms that are constantly in flux as our beliefs and circumstances change.
The terms we use, and the ways we write them, are less about saying or doing the \xe2\x80\x9ccorrect\xe2\x80\x9d thing, the thing that will prevent you from getting flamed on Twitter or earning an eye roll in a staff meeting. Rather, it\xe2\x80\x99s about what we want words to do for us and the arguments we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to make about ourselves and the world through the words we choose.
So, what am I trying to do when I capitalize White? One of my favorite sci-fi tropes is the archetypal scene in which a character tests whether an invisible force field is present by throwing something at it and then standing back cautiously to observe the almost-imperceptible buzz at the moment of impact. Where there appears to be nothing at all, there is, in fact, danger. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I hope to do, in a small way, when I capitalize White. I\xe2\x80\x99m throwing a stick at the force field around the McCloskeys. I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to say, in a small way, \xe2\x80\x9cI think there\xe2\x80\x99s something there.\xe2\x80\x9d
