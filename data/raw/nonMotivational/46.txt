There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing we love more at the Fearless publication than justice for survivors being served on a cold plate of justice.
And Ron Jeremy, porn icon in the adult industry, is about to be served a heaping portion of his.
On August 31, it was announced that 20 more charges of sexual assault against 13 additional women will be laid on Jeremy, on top of the 6 he was already served in June 2020, which could ultimately lead to an overall sentence of 250 years in prison for his heinous acts.
The #MeToo and survivor community are pre-celebrating this massive win, because it is so uncommon for attackers to be prosecuted, even less likely for a celebrity attacker to be prosecuted, and to top it all off a potential sentence of 250 years? Fantastic.
These additional charges follow his conviction of assaulting 4 women in 2014. He would have faced 90 years in prison if convicted of the first set of charges in June.
Now, there\xe2\x80\x99s another 140 years of prison time potentially stacked on top of that.
We never see numbers like that\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94 but we\xe2\x80\x99re thrilled that in this case the punishment somewhat matches the crime of the deep and traumatic violation of his victims.
It\xe2\x80\x99s already a massive victory for us all, hopefully ensuring that this monster can no longer violate another human being, and will rot in jail for the rest of his days.
The victims' ages span from 15\xe2\x80\x9354.
The 15-year-old survivor was passed out when Jeremy assaulted her with objects and his own body. This charge dates back to 2004.
The latest charge took place on January 2020, where Jeremy allegedly sexually assaulted a 21-year-old woman outside a Hollywood business.
Jeremy denies any sexual misconduct, but the evidence and victim testimonial count is stacking up against him.
There\xe2\x80\x99s no where else left for this monster to run and hide.
He is currently being held on a $6.6 million dollar bail.
The concept of consent already seems a little too grey for most of society, making trials revolving around sexual assault especially tough\xc2\xa0to\xc2\xa0prosecute.
The whole idea of consent being something that can be given and then taken away, or not being there at all even\xc2\xa0if\xc2\xa0one\xc2\xa0is\xc2\xa0wearing\xc2\xa0revealing\xc2\xa0clothing, becomes a very \xe2\x80\x98tough\xe2\x80\x99 philosophical debate for puny minds with misogynistic thinking.
When at the end of the day, consent is very black and white\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s either given enthusiastically or it isn\xe2\x80\x99t.
And just because an attacker thought it was there, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it actually was.
Our fellow survivors in the porn industry, who are among Ron Jeremy\xe2\x80\x99s survivors, really have an uphill battle on this front\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94 part of their job is performing sexual acting, which requires their consensual participation on a daily basis.
It would be all too easy for our patriarchal society to deem adult actresses as \xe2\x80\x9cautomatically having activated consent at all times\xe2\x80\x9d because of their choice of profession.
Just as I knew justice would not be on my side because my attacker was someone I was dating romantically at the\xc2\xa0time,\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0odds\xc2\xa0were\xc2\xa0against\xc2\xa0me\xc2\xa0when\xc2\xa0it\xc2\xa0came\xc2\xa0to\xc2\xa0being\xc2\xa0believed. I knew the statistics. And so, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t step forward to press charges.
I\xe2\x80\x99m at peace now with that decision\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94 but, and understandably\xc2\xa0so, not everyone can find peace without justice. And that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what these survivors did. Their bravery is unparalleled and beyond comprehension\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99m so proud of these women for all they\xe2\x80\x99ve done for the sexual assault survivor community already, just by being brave enough to step forward and speak up.
Despite the unquestionable re-traumatization they\xe2\x80\x99ll experience during the trial, they\xe2\x80\x99re securing justice not only for themselves, but every survivor out there.
Ron Jeremy has likely had more sex than anyone you or I know. Maybe, in his career\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime, he\xe2\x80\x99s had more sex than every person you know added up together.
And so, with access to so much sex, that he also gets paid handsomely for, why the need to forcibly assault others for sex when frequent access was accessible whenever he wanted it?
The answer to that is that it was never about sex\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94 it was always about power. That\xe2\x80\x99s what sexual assault is\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94 a power move.
And it\xe2\x80\x99s generally just an abuse of power, in a lot of cases. As a porn icon, Ron Jeremy would have all the connections to get a new up-in-coming or aspiring adult actress into the spotlight\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94 in exchange for a bit of payoff.
An \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll scratch your back if you scratch mine\xe2\x80\x9d sort of exchange.
Sexual assault has always been a power move, abuse of power, and psychological game for building the egos of pathetic, insecure attackers since its first use.
It\xe2\x80\x99s never been about sexual gratification\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s always been about psychological domination and breaking of spirit\xc2\xa0of\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0victim.
That\xe2\x80\x99s why this teeny tiny, poor excuse for a human being went out of his way to rape women when he could go to work and have consensual sex\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94 because he likes the domination, and the power, and the act of reducing women to nothing more than a sex object to get off\xc2\xa0on\xc2\xa0or\xc2\xa0inside\xc2\xa0of.
There\xe2\x80\x99s a good reason the United Nations officially considers rape a war crime\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94 it always has, and always will, come down to power and domination over another person, meant to shatter them completely.
This is such a big win for us, as an active community in the global #MeToo conversation.
I am so pleased to know that this bucket of filth will likely be spending the rest of his days trapped behind bars, with all of his life luxuries stripped away from him.
Anyone who violates others in such a heinous and damaging way does not deserve the luxuries this world has to offer.
He committed the crime\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94 now he should pay the ultimate price\xc2\xa0for\xc2\xa0his\xc2\xa0actions.
Unable to pay such a hefty bail price of over $6,000,000, it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that Jeremy will remain in jail until his trial concludes.
To which many of us say, \xe2\x80\x9cGreat!\xe2\x80\x9d, because it means he can\xe2\x80\x99t harass, attack or traumatize any other victims while he\xe2\x80\x99s in custody.
The hope, always in these cases, is that the survivors of the atrocities will get the justice they deserve, and that the vicious attacker will be put and kept behind bars so that he cannot violate any other people\xc2\xa0ever\xc2\xa0again.
The amount of entitlement in this case is absolutely astonishing\xe2\x80\xa6 and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly why #MeToo survivors are fighting tooth and nail to bring justice to those who have had to stay silent for so long.
We\xe2\x80\x99re not silent anymore.
And our perpetrators should be afraid\xe2\x80\xa6 because we\xe2\x80\x99re coming for all of them.
