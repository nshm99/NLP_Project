Here\xe2\x80\x99s what we know happened. At 5PM on Tuesday, a man began shooting people at a massage parlour. Less than an hour later, he went to another one, and began to shoot even more people. While the police went to that location, across the street, at yet another massage parlour, another person was shot. The final tally? Eight.
Horrific. And yet there are so many twisted layers of hate and violence here, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to even begin to know where to unpack them. Let\xe2\x80\x99s continue with what happened next.
The Mayor of Atlanta got on TV and said: \xe2\x80\x9cA motive is still not clear.\xe2\x80\x9d The Police Chief, appearing to sympathise with the gunman, said: \xe2\x80\x9che was a sex addict\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9che had a bad day.\xe2\x80\x9d Wait, what? A motive isn\xe2\x80\x99t clear? He was a sex addict? He had a bad day?
Let me put it like this. America\xe2\x80\x99s normalised fascist terrorism.
If a man travels across a city, targeting and shooting women, that is more than enough for it to be a hate crime. It is misogynist violence. But what happened here is even worse than that.
A man of a certain kind travelled across a city shooting women of a certain kind \xe2\x80\x94 and anyone else unfortunate enough to be alongside them. Asian women. And not even just Asian women. Asian women working at massage parlours.
Massage parlours in America are of course notorious hotbeds of human trafficking. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a dude, you might be about to object to that. So go ahead and ask yourself: would you really want your wife or daughter or niece to work at a massage parlour? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think so. Women work such jobs, often, because they have to. They might even defend having to work such jobs, that\xe2\x80\x99s true, and in their limited circumstances, working such jobs might feel like relative freedom. But nobody should have work a job that is right at the edge of degradation.
Does that mean that all body-work \xe2\x80\x94 massages and the like \xe2\x80\x94 are degrading? Of course not. But it does mean that when there is such a thing as exploitation and degradation, and it intersects altogether too neatly with race, class, ethnicity, and profession.
The women that this man targeted \xe2\x80\x94 literally \xe2\x80\x94 with bullets were, in other words, some of the most dispossessed and degraded and exploited figures in American culture. Women who are barely considered women at all. Asian women at the edges of \xe2\x80\x9csex work,\xe2\x80\x9d as we euphemistically call it these days, as if selling your body is just like, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, being a teacher or hedge fund manager. Of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s not \xe2\x80\x94 and if you are forced into it, like so many women are, it leaves lasting scars and serious trauma behind it.
Think about American culture for a second. How are Asian women portrayed? Well, usually, they\xe2\x80\x99re not. The leading woman \xe2\x80\x94 the stereotype \xe2\x80\x94 is usually blonde, thin, and petite. Maybe brunette, if a culture industry is trying to be edgy. These days, once in a while, it\xe2\x80\x99s a black lady \xe2\x80\x94 and that\xe2\x80\x99s real progress. But Asians? They\xe2\x80\x99re relegated to the sidelines. Asian men are considered effective castrati \xe2\x80\x94 without the masculine qualities to play the stereotypical American hero. And Asian women are a bigger problem entirely. What are they? They are left to hold all the racist baggage still assigned to Asians. They\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x9cbitchy\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinscrutable,\xe2\x80\x9d they\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpushy,\xe2\x80\x9d they\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x9csexy\xe2\x80\x9d and a little bit \xe2\x80\x9cspicy.\xe2\x80\x9d What the? How is a person\xe2\x80\xa6spicy?
Now let\xe2\x80\x99s come to the alleged killer. He was, as you might expect, a white dude. Given the track record of white dudes in America, he\xe2\x80\x99s probably going to be found to be a Trump sympathiser and Fox News watcher and all the rest of it \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s just simple statistics.
White American men live in a culture of extreme entitlement. Their culture says that everything is owed to them. Everything. A job, money, a career, upward mobility, a fine house, cars to put in the garage. And women\xe2\x80\x99s bodies.
When white men in America don\xe2\x80\x99t have these things, they lash out in rage. Of course, that culture goes well beyond America. Alek Minassian killed women in Toronto because his thwarted entitlement ended in an explosion of rage. Jesse Kempson killed Grace Millane in New Zealand, after raping a former Tinder date and abusing his partner.
Still, Canada and New Zealand are cultures which have made far, far more progress against both misogyny and racism than America has. Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s just simple statistics, from women\xe2\x80\x99s participation in politics, to gender pay gaps, to incidences of abuse, to minorities imprisoned. America is, by a very long way, the most misogynistic and racist society in the rich world. And before you doubt me, go ahead and remind me again how many days it\xe2\x80\x99s been since Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s been out of office \xe2\x80\x94 and what his attitudes towards women and minorities were.
They were hateful. They were fascist. What does the fascist mind believe? In a hierarchy of personhood. At the top sit a certain kind of people, then other below them. And as the threshold of personhood is crossed sit, finally, still others. In the Trumpist mind, this hierarchy of personhood is easy to deduce \xe2\x80\x94 because America\xe2\x80\x99s Nazis speak of it openly, as the foundation of the kind of society they want to build. At the top come \xe2\x80\x9cpure blooded\xe2\x80\x9d white men, then below them, \xe2\x80\x9cpure blooded\xe2\x80\x9d white women, below them, the \xe2\x80\x9cmixed races,\xe2\x80\x9dagain, in order of gender. Finally, as the threshold of personhood is crossed come the minorities \xe2\x80\x94 Black People, Latinos, Hispanics, Asians. They are not considered people at all. And women are even less than men.
In American society, there is no worse place to be than to be a minority woman \xe2\x80\x94 a woman of colour, as Americans put it. That\xe2\x80\x99s not my opinion, again, it\xe2\x80\x99s just statistics. Women of colour suffer the worst outcomes in America, by a very long way, whether they\xe2\x80\x99re economic, cultural, social, or emotional. Even where they are seen as \xe2\x80\x9ceconomically successful,\xe2\x80\x9d like Asians are perceived to be, that stereotype only exists to hide a dark underbelly and underworld of exploitation and degradation \xe2\x80\x94 poverty, exclusion, abuse, and trauma.
Like the Asian women who work at \xe2\x80\x9cmassage parlors.\xe2\x80\x9d Imagine what happens when they go for interview at nice and fine companies and corporations, hoping to work in offices, where bodily violence isn\xe2\x80\x99t a fact of everyday life, or at least less so. All those companies and corporations are still run by white dudes. And those Asian women probably get polite, vacant stares, and are told they\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x9cnot a good fit\xe2\x80\x9d or they \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t match the culture\xe2\x80\x9d and so on.
That\xe2\x80\x99s true, they don\xe2\x80\x99t. But only because American culture is incredibly racist and misogynistic. And before you argue about that, consider, again that 6 Asian women were just killed for being Asian women.
Now let\xe2\x80\x99s come back to the shooter. Let\xe2\x80\x99s imagine the mindset of a hypothetical shooter committing this kind of crime. No, that\xe2\x80\x99s not unfair \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s the job of any civilized person. If he was just a garden variety misogynist, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be shooting women. He\xe2\x80\x99d be at home wanking off to pics of women he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9chave,\xe2\x80\x9d calling himself an incel, and crying tears of rage when he was finished. If he was just a step up from that \xe2\x80\x94 a violent misogynist \xe2\x80\x94 he\xe2\x80\x99d have found a few women of his own to brutalise, trapping them, maybe, in abusive relationships. If he was one step up from that \xe2\x80\x94 a misogynistic killer \xe2\x80\x94 then he\xe2\x80\x99d have had a much easier time killing white women. After all, there are a whole lot more of them in the South than there are Asian women.
This is a man who seems to have gone out of his way to kill a certain type of person. Asian women. Because, obviously, he hated them. What does it tell us when someone hates another kind of person enough to kill not just one of them, but many of them? That they do not consider this group of people to be human beings. They probably consider them to be \xe2\x80\x9clower\xe2\x80\x9d down in the fictional hierarchy of personhood they\xe2\x80\x99ve internalised than their dog or cat. They hate them because they see them as dangerous and sinister beings who have taken away what they are entitled to. In this case, the white male entitlement access to women\xe2\x80\x99s bodies.
Sadly, terribly, and predictably enough, for this man, exploiting women as objects of sexualised hate only led his self-hate to increase. The logic is simple. Every time he engaged in the transaction of exploitation, he was confirming his belief that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worthy of a social relationship with a woman, a consensual one, just an economic one, and that even women who weren\xe2\x80\x99t people didn\xe2\x80\x99t consider him therefore a man. You can see how his rage escalated to breaking point. And yet that\xe2\x80\x99s not to legitimise it or justify it. It is to explain how American ideals of masculinity are so toxic they are literally fascist.
It\xe2\x80\x99s hard, at least for many Americans, to wrap your head around, after all, the idea of \xe2\x80\x9cwomen who aren\xe2\x80\x99t even considered people.\xe2\x80\x9d But that is what America teaches its men \xe2\x80\x94 it is the epitome and essence of patriarchal violence that women aren\xe2\x80\x99t considered people at all, but a \xe2\x80\x9csecond caste\xe2\x80\x9d as De Beauvoir wrote about. And when you consider women unpeople \xe2\x80\x94 then it\xe2\x80\x99s all that much easier to do violence to them, beginning with the most powerless and vulnerable of all.
Now let\xe2\x80\x99s come to the bizarre justifications. The gunman was a \xe2\x80\x9csex addict.\xe2\x80\x9d LOL. Do you see sex addicts going out after every meeting and shooting up the nearest bar? Strip club? Brothel? I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think so. It\xe2\x80\x99s a wash. Sex addiction doesn\xe2\x80\x99t justify mass murder. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even begin to remotely explain it.
It\xe2\x80\x99s a wash, too, the idea that \xe2\x80\x9cwe don\xe2\x80\x99t know what motivated these crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d Sure we do. If I go out and kill a certain type of person, over and over again, then it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty obvious I\xe2\x80\x99m a racist. What else could possibly prove it? If I go out of my way to kill women that I\xe2\x80\x99ve already been subjugating, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty clear I\xe2\x80\x99m a misogynist. What else could possibly prove it?
The defences already emerging for the gunman only reveal how broken American culture is. He is being defended, but none of the people defending him are his lawyer. They\xe2\x80\x99re the ones \xe2\x80\x94 the Mayor, the Police Chief, and so on \xe2\x80\x94 who are supposed to be keeping people safe from violence, for Pete\xe2\x80\x99s sake.
What do you see in all that, in all those layers of hate and violence, so twisted in on themselves they can barely be picked apart?
I see a society that has normalised fascist violence. Women are not really considered people in America yet \xe2\x80\x94 which is why, say, passing equal rights bills is still something that\xe2\x80\x99s contentious and \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversial.\xe2\x80\x9d Minorities are barely people, either \xe2\x80\x94 you only need to look to the Trumpists for evidence of that. Put them both together, and you have a powder keg waiting to explode.
The mentality of white masculinity in America teaches men they\xe2\x80\x99re entitled to everything \xe2\x80\x94 money, power, sex, women\xe2\x80\x99s bodies. And furthermore, they\xe2\x80\x99re entitled to explode in rage and violence if their expectations aren\xe2\x80\x99t met. American men are socialised into that belief system early, and often, from grade school, to high school sports and its open misogyny, to \xe2\x80\x9cfrats\xe2\x80\x9d and their brutality and stupidity, to the way sexual harassment is a regular feature of working life, and abuse is a regular feature of relationships.
Men are taught to be entitled to everything, from power over other men who are more feminine, to women\xe2\x80\x99s bodies \xe2\x80\x94 and when they don\xe2\x80\x99t get it, they\xe2\x80\x99re taught to be entitled to violence and rage.
But all that is just fascism, restated. Fascism\xe2\x80\x99s the internalised hierarchy of personhood. And when men are taught they\xe2\x80\x99re entitled to power over everything and everyone else, from minorities to women\xe2\x80\x99s bodies, that all the opportunities and chances and possibilities in society belong to them \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s ok to explode in rage and violence if they don\xe2\x80\x99t get it \xe2\x80\x94 then that is just another way to install people with a fascist belief system. Not just men, it should be said, but also women and minorities who accept their place on this grim and foolish ladder of personhood and power.
The Atlanta shootings are troubling because many, many people died. But I think they are troubling, too, for a deeper reason. Many people died in an example of fascist violence. Of male entitlement erupting into mass murder. Racist, misogynist mass murder.
It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to say that\xe2\x80\x99s not fascism. And that America still has so much trouble comprehending, understanding, seeing, saying that it is is the biggest giveaway of all \xe2\x80\x94 of how normalised fascist violence \xe2\x80\x94 fascist terrorism \xe2\x80\x94 really is.
