Like many people, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been wrestling with the Babe post that came out over the weekend. For those of you who haven\xe2\x80\x99t read it, it\xe2\x80\x99s the story of a girl, \xe2\x80\x9cGrace,\xe2\x80\x9d who went on a date with Aziz Ansari, the writer and star of the Netflix show Master of None, and was sexually assaulted.
But part of the reason I\xe2\x80\x99ve been wrestling with this article is because I, like many, many, many others, am having a hard time convincing myself that this was, in fact, a sexual assault.
Part of this uncertainty comes from the fact that the conversation about what constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9csexual assault\xe2\x80\x9d is a reasonably nascent one. Depending on who you ask, sexual assault can encompass everything from the ickiness of the bad date described in the short story Cat Person to the disturbing atrocities committed by the likes of Harvey Weinstein.
Another part of my uncertainty comes from wondering how much of sexual signaling is lost in translation. It seems obvious that a verbal \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d is impossible to misread, but at the same time, we live in a world where the media encourages women to say \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d when they mean \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d when they mean \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d
And, possibly the biggest part of my uncertainty comes from the fact that if this counts as sexual assault, then I\xe2\x80\x99ve been sexually assaulted. Multiple times.
From the dozens of comment threads and articles I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen around this topic, I know what the answers to my questions are. Or at least, what they\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be.
I understand these arguments, and sometimes I even agree with these conclusions\xe2\x80\xa6
\xe2\x80\xa6but sometimes I don\xe2\x80\x99t.
Sometimes I wonder about drunk sex, and I wonder about how clunky and awkward it would be to constantly be assuring the person you\xe2\x80\x99ve been married to for twenty-five years that, yes, tonight, once again, you have permission to take off my shirt.
Sometimes I wonder about the times where I\xe2\x80\x99ve given a \xe2\x80\x9cplayful no\xe2\x80\x9d or when my \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d didn\xe2\x80\x99t really mean \xe2\x80\x9cno,\xe2\x80\x9d I was just trying to seem busy and sought-after.
I wonder about the times where I have been the pusher, not taking no for an answer.
I wonder about the times where I said \xe2\x80\x9cyes!\xe2\x80\x9d because I wanted to be enthusiastic, and I wonder about the times where I was enthusiastic in the moment, and then regretted it days, months, or years later.
I wonder about my own \xe2\x80\x9cCat Person\xe2\x80\x9d stories. My own Aziz Ansari stories. Even if they fit the definition, do I really, in my heart of hearts, believe that those were sexual assaults? And if I do believe that they were sexual assaults, whose fault is that? Mine? His? Society\xe2\x80\x99s?
Does the term \xe2\x80\x9csexual assault\xe2\x80\x9d lose its potency when it applies to so many sexual encounters?
And worst of all, I wonder if I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong for wondering these things. I wonder if my internalized misogyny has made me a rape apologist and victim blamer. I wonder if posting this is going to make people I\xe2\x80\x99ve known for twenty years block me on social media, or if it\xe2\x80\x99s going to hurt my career, or my feminist credibility, or if I\xe2\x80\x99m triggering the victims of the sexual assaults by questioning the articles published about it\xe2\x80\xa6 but aren\xe2\x80\x99t we supposed to distrust everything we read on the internet anyway? Who am I to believe anything anymore???
The only conclusion I have reached is that there doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be one conclusion.
I am glad that \xe2\x80\x9cGrace\xe2\x80\x9d has sparked a conversation about a sexual experience that so many people can relate to. It is easy to condemn the Harvey Weinsteins of the world, but this situation is more immediate and challenging, and not just because it affects so many of us. This situation warrants discussion because it has nuance. It is more than a simple abuse of power, it is more than a corrupt entertainment industry, and it is worth more of the collective attention than it is granted by a dismissal in the form of a moral judgment on Aziz himself.
This could have been about anybody.
This situation requires a complete reevaluation of what it means to have consensual sex. This requires conversations about the definition of \xe2\x80\x9csexual assault\xe2\x80\x9d, about the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cconsent\xe2\x80\x9d, about the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cabuse of power.\xe2\x80\x9d
But I want to emphasize that these are conversations. We are allowed to disagree about definitions, about what lines to draw in the sand, and we are allowed to reach different conclusions from reading the same article.
And, most importantly, we are allowed to \xe2\x80\x94 no, we should \xe2\x80\x94 have impassioned debates after the fact.
The response to an opposing viewpoint from a trusted, intelligent, good-hearted person should be a debate. Impassioned, maybe. Angry, perhaps. But a debate nonetheless. Discussion is the only way to dissect nuance, to avoid blanket statements, and ultimately, to learn.
I still don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I feel about this Aziz Ansari story.
I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I should still enjoy Master of None, or if I should even watch reruns of Parks and Recreation.
I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I would do today if I were \xe2\x80\x9cGrace.\xe2\x80\x9d I barely even know how to define the times in my life when I\xe2\x80\x99ve been her.
I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the best way to re-socialize women so that they feel comfortable saying \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the best way to re-socialize men to respect women when they say it.
But I know that these are conversations I want to keep having. I want to have them on Facebook and I want to have them over the Thanksgiving dinner table. I want to have them in the comments section of a New York Times article, and I want to have them in a Messenger thread with my best friends from twenty years ago. I want to have this conversation over and over and over again so that I know for sure where I stand.
Having this conversation with people who agree with me feels good and validates my feelings, and in a world where we almost elected Roy Moore to the senate, it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to be reminded that I\xe2\x80\x99m not alone in my beliefs.
But most importantly, I want to have this conversation with people who disagree with me. It may not feel as good, it may not be as validating, or as easy, or as fun as discussing with people on my side, but it is the best way for me to wrestle with these hard problems. It\xe2\x80\x99s the best way for me to stop wondering and start knowing, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the best way to be certain that my opinions are my own.
