Sometimes I wish I could gather up all the women I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever known, or encountered, and conduct this informal poll:
Raise your hand if you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever behaved badly and blamed it on your period.
Raise your hand if you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever acted helpless in the face of an unpleasant-if-not-physically-demanding task like dealing with a wild animal that\xe2\x80\x99s gotten inside the house.
Raise your hand if you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever coerced a man into sex even though he didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to really want it.
Raise your hand if you\xe2\x80\x99ve thought you were at liberty to do this coercing because men \xe2\x80\x9calways want it\xe2\x80\x9d and should feel lucky any time they get it.
Raise your hand if you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever threatened to harm yourself if a man breaks up with you or doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see you anymore.
Raise your hand if you\xe2\x80\x99ve been physically abusive with a male partner, knowing you\xe2\x80\x99d be unlikely to face any legal consequences.
Raise your hand if you\xe2\x80\x99ve lied about being on birth control, or faked a pregnancy scare, to see how a man would respond.
Raise your hand if you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever manipulated a divorce or child custody dispute in your favor by falsely insinuating that a man has been abusive toward you or your child.
In this hypothetical gathering of every woman I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever known or encountered (I\xe2\x80\x99m imagining a football stadium at decent capacity), I\xe2\x80\x99m certain there is not a single one of these questions that, if answered honestly, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t send hands into the air. Including my own. I know I\xe2\x80\x99m guilty on the pest control front. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to think too hard about some of the others.
We hear all too much about toxic masculinity, that amorphous term that refers to the way traits like aggression and emotional repression are baked into male social norms. It also frequently shows up in online feminism as lazy shorthand for registering disapproval of just about anything men do at all. But when are we going to grant equal rights to women and admit that toxic femininity also exists and can be just as poisonous?
There are minor forms of feminine toxins, like blaming irrational temper tantrums on \xe2\x80\x9cbeing hormonal\xe2\x80\x9d or feigning helplessness in order to get what you want. And there are major toxins, many having to do with weaponizing your fragility so that those to whom you cause harm have a difficult time defending themselves, lest they look like the aggressors. Women, of course, can unleash these tactics on other women, be they romantic partners or not. But for the sake of this discussion, let\xe2\x80\x99s say we are talking about women and men and sex. We\xe2\x80\x99ve established that many men are socially conditioned to think that women owe them sex. But what about the women that assume that men should be grateful for any sex they get?
In a free society, everyone, regardless of gender, is free to be a manipulative, narcissistic, emotionally destructive asshole.
Throughout my life, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard countless men tell stories about going ahead with sex even though they didn\xe2\x80\x99t really want to. Sometimes, it was because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to hurt the woman\xe2\x80\x99s feelings. Other times, it was because they feared being perceived as having a low sex drive.
A remarkable number of men have told me about times when women approached them and, often wordlessly, initiated sexual encounters without the slightest provocation or questions asked. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard, more than once, about unsolicited hand jobs on school buses when they were boys. Also, more than once, men have told me about past grade school camping trips or overnight parties wherein girls they barely knew slipped into their sleeping bags or beds. In some cases, the men were happy to oblige the women\xe2\x80\x99s desires. In other cases, though, they went through with the encounters because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to make an awkward situation even more awkward.
These stories have been relayed to me in a tone I can only describe as bafflement. The men are not complaining, but nor are they boasting. If anything, they seem to be struggling to find the words to describe a not-entirely-welcome encounter that they felt they had no right to regard with anything other than gratitude. Needless to say, if you imagined any of these situations with the genders reversed, you\xe2\x80\x99d have the potential for very different framing.
I realize that the physical size difference between most women and most men means that the above comparison isn\xe2\x80\x99t entirely fair; a woman who\xe2\x80\x99s sexually aggressive with a man is probably not putting him in insurmountable physical danger. And I\xe2\x80\x99m cognizant of the fact that for every bad behavior I mentioned in my opening list of questions there is an equal, opposite, and potentially more physically threatening form of bad behavior that men can, and do, visit upon women with just as much frequency.
But that, right there, is precisely my point. In a free society, everyone, regardless of gender, or any other identification, is free to be a manipulative, narcissistic, emotionally destructive asshole. So I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why men have been getting all the credit lately.
The #BelieveWomen memes that have arisen in the wake of #MeToo in general, and the Brett Kavanaugh saga in particular, are coming from a place of empathy and good intentions. But they\xe2\x80\x99re also stripping women of our complications and contradictions, and therefore our humanity.
For what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, I believed Christine Blasey Ford\xe2\x80\x99s testimony about what happened between her and Kavanaugh when they were in high school. It is my personal belief, based on nothing more than gut feeling, that things transpired more or less as Ford described them and that Kavanaugh was too drunk at the time to remember. I believe that Kavanaugh effectively lied under oath about the extent of his drinking, and that this alone should have disqualified him from holding a seat on the Supreme Court.
But there is a difference between believing and knowing. Even if the judiciary committee had done the right thing and subpoenaed Mark Judge, who witnessed the encounter between Ford and Kavanaugh, and forced him to testify under oath, no one would ever have known definitively what happened that evening. All the truth digging in the world will not change the fact that all kinds of people misrepresent, misremember, misinterpret, and willfully or unwillfully make misleading statements for all kinds of reasons.
And that is why #BelieveWomen, with its suggestion that women are some monolithic entity that is inherently more moral, innocent, or trustworthy than men, is not just reductive but insulting. Women are not simple, guileless creatures to whom only the most innocent motives should ever be ascribed. Both sexes contain multitudes. Or, as George Carlin put it, \xe2\x80\x9cMen are from Earth, women are from Earth. Deal with it.\xe2\x80\x9d
#MeToo is important. #BelieveWomen is hollow sloganeering.
My opening list of \xe2\x80\x9craise your hand\xe2\x80\x9d questions surely set some teeth on edge. It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to talk about things like women tricking men into getting them pregnant, not least of all because it makes you sound like a part of the men\xe2\x80\x99s rights movement \xe2\x80\x94 a loosely knit and often self-defeating enterprise that overrides legitimate grievances about, say, the family court system, with ambient misogyny and conspiracy theories. When I was in my twenties, just hearing a phrase like \xe2\x80\x9ctricking men\xe2\x80\x9d would have made me assume it was coming from a woman-hating kook.
But the thing about growing older is that over the years, you run into more and more people and see all the different kinds of havoc they can wreak. I know men who, amid contentious divorce proceedings, have been accused, preposterously, of spousal and child abuse. I know women who are so skilled in the dark art of gaslighting that the targets of their mind games, be it boyfriends or BFFs, don\xe2\x80\x99t stand a chance. Once, while working with high school students, I overheard some girls joking to one another about how they were going to go out that night and \xe2\x80\x9chit on older guys who don\xe2\x80\x99t know we\xe2\x80\x99re underage and later be like \xe2\x80\x98Dude, you\xe2\x80\x99re a pedophile.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d
I decided to give the girls the benefit of the doubt and assume they were just goofing around, condemning misogynist stereotypes about young women as jailbait by ironically reclaiming those stereotypes. Along the way, I tried to think like a good feminist and consider that patriarchal societies foster or even force this kind of manipulative female behavior because it\xe2\x80\x99s often the only power available to women.
But that\xe2\x80\x99s an excuse and a poor one. Some women act abominably because some people act abominably.
The famous line \xe2\x80\x9cFeminism is the radical notion that women are people\xe2\x80\x9d has been popping up on bumper stickers and T-shirts since the 1980s. But in 2018, many feminists seem illogically invested in the idea that women operate under a different set of standards and practices than men and might, in fact, be something rather separate from \xe2\x80\x9cpeople.\xe2\x80\x9d They will say this is because women are still often reduced to second-class citizens; underpaid in the labor force, underrepresented in politics, and undermined and ignored when, like Ford, they speak up about their experiences.
But can we please put this into some perspective? There is now an entire literary genre \xe2\x80\x94 and, more than that, vast quarters of the mainstream media \xe2\x80\x94 devoted to women speaking up about their experiences. Every day, the stories roll across my news feeds faster than I could possibly read them, their headlines tweaked to clickbait perfection. \xe2\x80\x9cThanks for not raping us, all you \xe2\x80\x98good men.\xe2\x80\x99 But it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough,\xe2\x80\x9d went the headline of a Washington Post guest opinion column earlier this month.
Meanwhile, when men speak up about what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to be accused of sexual misconduct \xe2\x80\x94 or just navigate the sexual arena in general \xe2\x80\x94 the only culturally sanctioned response is to paint them as entitled whiners at best and narcissistic and, of course, toxic sociopaths at worst.
#MeToo is important. #BelieveWomen is hollow sloganeering that will ultimately set us back rather than move us forward. Like all movements, #MeToo will live or die by the degree to which it\xe2\x80\x99s willing to let people in. Until it makes room for examinations not just of toxic masculinity but also toxic femininity\xe2\x80\x94and, even better, dispatch with these meaningless terms\xe2\x80\x94it will continue to tell only half the story. Until it admits that women can be as manipulative and creepy and generally awful as men, the movement will continue to send a message that we\xe2\x80\x99re not really whole people. And why would anyone believe someone like that?
