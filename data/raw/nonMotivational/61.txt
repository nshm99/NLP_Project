All stories about abuse are hard. For me, this one is the hardest. It\xe2\x80\x99s the hardest because it\xe2\x80\x99s the truest, and because it complicates our impulse to separate the good guys from the bad guys. My husband was one of each.
When his dark side was in control, he was abusive; there is no disputing this. He would scream at me, threaten me, call me names; he monitored my phone and laptop; he isolated me; he lied, he stole, and he drank until his face twisted into a sneer and his normally soft-spoken voice curdled into a vicious snarl.
That\xe2\x80\x99s part of the story.
The other part is the love. The other part contains the chapters in which he and I talk about nothing, about everything, for hours on end. It contains the chapters in which we make love, in a way I never had before and probably never will again. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just that he was skilled and giving in bed \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s that he was kind. It\xe2\x80\x99s that he made me feel safe and accepted in a way I did not know was possible.
Domestic abuse incubates in the cradle, in what\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be the safest and softest place. The feathered down of the nest morphs slowly into poisoned spikes.
It contains the chapters in which he makes me laugh until my sides hurt; he is still the funniest person I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever known. It contains the chapter in which he stays up all night with my best friend\xe2\x80\x99s dying dog, gently tending to the animal after my friend collapsed from sadness and exhaustion. It contains the chapter in which he sits quietly next to a homeless woman to protect her from men on the street who were harassing her.
When the danger had passed and I gestured that we needed to keep moving \xe2\x80\x94 we had a plane to catch \xe2\x80\x94 the woman cried and clung to him. It broke my heart, because I knew how she felt. I never wanted to let go of him either.
When, several years into our relationship, his dark side began to appear, it was terrifying in its intensity and abruptness. It was not like living with one person who had a variety of moods; it was like there were suddenly two of him \xe2\x80\x94 two entirely different and opposite characters whom I never saw in the same place at the same time. It was literally unnerving. My nerves were coming apart, bifurcating beneath my skin.
Domestic abuse is perhaps the most insidious of crimes, because it incubates in the cradle, in what\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to be the safest and softest place. The feathered down of the nest morphs slowly into poisoned spikes, one at a time, until everyone within it remains bound by nettles and the delusional hope that the whole thing will reverse.
The violation of intimacy hurts most. I turned myself inside out for this person, exposed every chink, every scar, every raw place, and every bruise. I said, Here, you can have everything. I trust you. How had I been so wrong? Had I just been tricked? How could I be so tricked for so long? It seemed impossible.
And yet it was real. He was Jekyll and Hyde, my best friend and my worst enemy. I kept trying to reconcile everything. I could not accept that the good him would not prevail in the end. I honestly believed love could chase away the darkness so the so-called real man \xe2\x80\x94 the best-friend-Jekyll \xe2\x80\x94 would come back and stay. I thought that if I sat with him, just as he\xe2\x80\x99d sat with the mentally ill homeless woman, that the taunting and the terrorizing would eventually give up and leave.
But it didn\xe2\x80\x99t. It just got worse. Eventually, I could barely find Jekyll. I would just see fleeting glimpses of him pass over the face I almost didn\xe2\x80\x99t recognize anymore. I once saw a single tear slide down his cheek while he watched a news story about a young girl who jumped off the roof of her college dorm. The girl had long black hair, and she looked like his daughter from his first marriage.
By the time I left, literally in the dark of night, I was spending all my days on the lower rungs of Maslow\xe2\x80\x99s Hierarchy, clamoring for shelter and safety, too scared and scattered to engage my intellect in any sort of productive way.
Now that we\xe2\x80\x99re out \xe2\x80\x94 now that my girls and I are safely settled in a new place whose location he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know \xe2\x80\x94 I am questioning everything. I divide my time between almost euphoric relief and crippling self-doubt.
What I\xe2\x80\x99m still questioning is how it all happened, how our relationship went from its beautiful genesis to its hideous disintegration.
The smallest things mean so much to me now \xe2\x80\x94 lying down to sleep in peace at night, being able to leave for work and not worry about what might be happening in our home, coming home from work to a small apartment that is tidy and predictable and secure.
But with the distance, with the relative calm, there is time to think, to question. I had to leave; I know that. I am not second-guessing that decision, because in the end it was not a choice; it was a flee for survival.
What I\xe2\x80\x99m still questioning is how it all happened, how our relationship went from its beautiful genesis to its hideous disintegration. It still seems impossible, as though these things don\xe2\x80\x99t just happen, as though there was something else wrong, something I missed at the time, something I didn\xe2\x80\x99t consider.
Could he have a brain tumor? Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, like all those old football players? Extraordinarily-early-onset dementia? Was none of it his fault? Did I abandon a sick person who just needed help? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I may never know.
And although I am doing well, there are days I feel completely lost, so sapped by regret and confusion that I just don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like keeping on. I want there to be some answer, some explanation, some conclusion. Hell, I want there to be an ending I can write to this story.
But there\xe2\x80\x99s not. There are none of those things. There\xe2\x80\x99s just what happened, in all of its beauty and ugliness and comedy and tragedy. There is just the sometimes nonsensical puzzle of life, and I just keep laying out the pieces, trying to match them up, trying to make them fit.
