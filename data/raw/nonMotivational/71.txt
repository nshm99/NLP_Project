I went to the marketWhere all the families shopI pulled out my Ka-barAnd started to chopYour left right left right left right killYour left right left right you know I will-Military cadence
\xe2\x80\x9cYou can shoot her\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d the First Sergeant tells me. \xe2\x80\x9cTechnically.\xe2\x80\x9d
We\xe2\x80\x99re standing on a rooftop watching black smoke pillars rise from a section of the city where two of my teammates are taking machine gun fire. Below, the small cluster of homes we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken over is taking sporadic fire as well. He hands me his rifle with a high powered scope and says, \xe2\x80\x9cSee for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d
It\xe2\x80\x99s the six year old girl who gives me flowers.
We call her the Flower Girl. She hangs around our combat outpost because we give her candy and hugs. She gives us flowers in return. What everyone else at the outpost knew (except for me, until that day) was that she also carried weapons for insurgents. Sometimes, in the midst of a firefight, she would carry ammunition across the street to unknown assailants.
According to the rules of engagement, we could shoot her. No one ever did. Not even when the First Sergeant morbidly reassured them on a rooftop in the middle of Iraq.
Other soldiers didn\xe2\x80\x99t end up as lucky.
Sometimes they would find themselves paired off against a woman or teenager intent on killing them. So they\xe2\x80\x99d pull the trigger. One of the sniper teams I worked with recounted an evening where he laid up a pile of people trying to plant an IED. It was a \xe2\x80\x9cturkey shoot,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me laughing. But then he got quiet and said, \xe2\x80\x9cEventually they sent out a woman and this dumb kid.\xe2\x80\x9d I didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to ask what happened. His voice said it all.
I often wonder what would have happened if the Flower Girl pointed a rifle at me, but I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid I already know. The thought didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter anyway. There was enough baggage from tours in Afghanistan and Iraq that coming home was full of uncertainty, anger, and confusion \xe2\x80\x94 and not, as I had been led to believe, warmth and safety.
\xe2\x80\x9cPeople only want to hear the Band of Brothers stories. The ones with guts and gusto! Not the one where you jam a gun in an old woman\xe2\x80\x99s face or shoot a kid.\xe2\x80\x9d I pause, then add, \xe2\x80\x9cLook around the room for a second\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d
Andy surveys the restaurant we\xe2\x80\x99re in for a moment while I lean in with a sardonic half-smile.
\xe2\x80\x9cHow many people can even relate to what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been through? What would they rather hear about? How Starbucks is giving away free lattes and puppies this week? Or how a soldier feels guilty because he pulled a trigger, lost a friend, or did morally questionable things in war? Hell, I want to hear about the latte giveaway\xe2\x80\xa6 especially if it\xe2\x80\x99s pumpkin spice.\xe2\x80\x9d
This eases the tension and he smiles.
Andy and I feel like we don\xe2\x80\x99t fit in. We met a few years ago at the church where he works, and where I volunteer. Of the thousands of people in the congregation, we are a handful of veterans. The veterans I meet are few and far between, and we typically end up running in the same circles.
How do you talk about morally reprehensible things that have left a bruise on your soul?
Years ago, Andy fought in the siege of Fallujah. We never readjusted to normal life after deployment. Instead, we found ourselves angry, depressed, violent, and drinking a lot. We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk to people about war or its cost because, well, how do you talk about morally reprehensible things that leave a bruise on your soul?
The guilt and moral tension many veterans feel is not necessarily post-traumatic stress disorder, but moral injury \xe2\x80\x94 the emotional shame and psychological damage soldiers incur when we have to do things that violate our sense of right and wrong. Shooting a woman or child. Killing another human. Watching a friend die. Laughing about situations that would normally disgust us.
Because so few in America have served, those who have can no longer relate to their peers, friends, and family. We fear being viewed as monsters, or lauded as heroes when we feel the things we\xe2\x80\x99ve done were morally ambiguous or wrong.
The U.S. is currently engaged in the longest running war in the history of the United States. We are entering our 15th year in Afghanistan, and we still station troops in some Iraqi outposts. In World War II, 11.5% of U.S. citizens served in four years. In Vietnam, 4.3% served in 12 years. Since 2001, only 0.86% of our population has served in the Global War on Terror. Yet, during World War II, 10 million men were drafted, and over 2 million men were conscripted during Vietnam. Despite the length of the Iraq and Afghan Wars, there has been no draft, whereas in times past, shorter wars cost us millions of young men. Instead, less than 1% of the population has borne this burden, with repeated tours continually deteriorating our troops\xe2\x80\x99 mental health.
The gap between citizens and soldiers is growing ever wider. During WWII, the entire nation\xe2\x80\x99s focus was on purchasing war bonds and defeating the Nazis. Movie previews and radio shows gave updates on the war effort. Today\xe2\x80\x99s citizens, however, are quickly amused by the latest Kardashian scandal on TV, which gives no reminder of the men and women dying overseas. Because people are more concerned about enjoying their freedoms and going about their day to day lives, veterans can feel like outcasts. As though nothing we did mattered to a country that asked us to go.
This is part of the problem with a soldier\xe2\x80\x99s alienation. People quickly point out that we weren\xe2\x80\x99t forced to join the military and fight in a war. We could have stayed home. The counterpoint is that, because the U.S. has now transitioned to an all-volunteer force, those opposed to war should be thanking their lucky stars that volunteers bear the burden of combat.
Additionally, regardless of whether you\xe2\x80\x99re Republican, Democrat, Libertarian, Communist, Liberal, Conservative, Conscientious Objector, or Pacifist, we all sent the soldier overseas. Because we live in a democracy, we vote to put men and women in charge of governing our affairs, and those elected representatives send troops overseas. We may have voted for someone else, but it does not change the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99ve put ourselves under the governance of the United States. When you live in a country, you submit yourself to their governing body and laws \xe2\x80\x94 even if you don\xe2\x80\x99t vote.
The citizen at home may not have pulled the trigger, but they asked the soldier to go in their place.
By shirking responsibility, civilians only alienate our soldiers more. The moral quagmire we face on the battlefield continues to dump shame and guilt onto our shoulders while they enjoy the benefits of passing the buck and asking, \xe2\x80\x9cWhose fault is it, really?\xe2\x80\x9d
On March 3, 1986, 11 years after the end of the Vietnam War, Metallica released their critically acclaimed album Master of Puppets. On the album, a song entitled \xe2\x80\x9cDisposable Heroes\xe2\x80\x9d tells the story of a young man used as cannon fodder in the midst of war, and the terror that enveloped him on the battlefield. Three years later, Metallica released \xe2\x80\x9cOne,\xe2\x80\x9d a song about a soldier who lost all his limbs and waits helplessly for death. The song won a Grammy for Best Metal Performance.
In an odd twist, both songs are amazingly popular among members of the United States military. During my time at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center, we had an entire platoon that could practically sing every last lyric to \xe2\x80\x9cOne.\xe2\x80\x9d In Afghanistan and Iraq, these songs were on playlists made to get soldiers amped before missions. We sang songs about dying on behalf of the people or coming home a vegetable. As crazy as that sounds, we sang those songs because they felt true. And they felt true because of the conversation we refuse to have as a country.
As Amy Amidon, a Navy psychologist, stated in an interview regarding moral injury:
Civilians are lucky that we still have a sense of naivet\xc3\xa9 about what the world is like. The average American means well, but what they need to know is that these [military] men and women are seeing incredible evil, and coming home with that weighing on them and not knowing how to fit back into society.
Most of the time, like the conversation Andy and I had, people only want to hear the heroics. They don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know what the war is costing our sons and daughters in regard to mental health, and this only makes the gap wider. In order for our soldiers to heal, society needs to own up to its part in sending us to war. The citizen at home may not have pulled the trigger, but they asked the soldier to go in their place. Citing a 2004 study, David Wood explains that the \xe2\x80\x9cgrief over losing a combat buddy was comparable, more than 30 years later, to that of a bereaved spouse whose partner had died in the previous six months.\xe2\x80\x9d The soul wounds we experience are much greater. Society needs to come alongside us rather than pointing us to the VA.
Historically, many cultures performed purification rites for soldiers returning home from war. These rites purified a broad spectrum of warriors, from the Roman Centurion to the Navajo to the Medieval Knight. Perhaps most fascinating is that soldiers returning home from the Crusades were instructed to observe a period of purification that involved the Christian church and their community. Though the church had sanctioned the Crusades, they viewed taking another life as morally wrong and damaging to their knights\xe2\x80\x99 souls.
No one in their right mind wants war. We want peace. And no one wants it more than the soldier.
Today, churches typically put veterans on stage to praise our heroics or speak of a great battle we\xe2\x80\x99ve overcome while drawing spiritual parallels for their congregation. What they don\xe2\x80\x99t do is talk about the moral weight we bear on their behalf.
Dr. Jonathan Shay, the clinical psychologist who coined the term moral injury, argues that in order for the soldier and society to find healing, we must come together and bear the moral responsibility of what soldiers have done in our name.
Whether you agree or disagree with war, you must remember that these are our fellow brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, flesh and blood. As veterans, we are desperate to reconnect with a world we feel no longer understands us. As a country, we must try and find common ground. We\xe2\x80\x99re not asking you to agree with our actions, but to help us bear the burden of carrying them on behalf of the country you live in. A staggering 22 veterans take their lives every day, and I can guarantee part of that is because of the citizen/soldier divide.
But what if it didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be this way? What if we could help our men and women in uniform bear the weight of this burden we carry? We should rethink exactly what war costs us and what we\xe2\x80\x99ve asked of those who\xe2\x80\x99ve fought on our behalf. In the end, no one in their right mind wants war. We want peace. And no one wants it more than the soldier. As General Douglas MacArthur eloquently put it:
\xe2\x80\x9cThe soldier above all other people prays for peace, for he must suffer and bear the deepest wounds and scars of war.\xe2\x80\x9d
