The first time I\xe2\x80\x99d heard of Tony Robbins was when I saw him at a live event in Toronto last year.
I\xe2\x80\x99d only gone to the event because I was a former Rachel Hollis fan at the time, and it was one of my all-time dreams to see her speak live.
Former, because since then I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned several realities about Hollis that I had vehemently denied for as long as possible, until it was all too clear I was fooling myself:

Before that conference in Toronto, October 2019, I really didn\xe2\x80\x99t know much about Tony Robbins, other than the fact that he once convinced Oprah to believe in herself enough to run across a bed of hot coals.
The friend who I went to Toronto with, the same one who had so loudly suggested I read Rachel Hollis\xe2\x80\x99work, said Robbins was inspiring. And I totally bought it.
I mean, I can always get on board with some positive, life-altering motivation.
I was in a conference centre with 10,000 other people\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94 likely people who loved Tony Robbins far more than I did.
The screaming and shrieking for him when he came out onto the stage was truly surreal.
After close to 6 hours of hearing a dozen guest speakers, including Rachel Hollis, Robbins finally took the stage. And that was where he remained for the next 4 hours.
As the hours passed, so did the chants and shouts and screams. He continued to encourage the crowd to scream at the top of their lungs, and chant back to him.
I looked around and felt a tad uneasy. \xe2\x80\x9cThis reminds me of a cult\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d a small voice said in the back of my head.
I shook it off and tried to get my money\xe2\x80\x99s worth from Robbins\xe2\x80\x99 supposed world-class motivational insights.
I ultimately wanted my life to change for the better, just like everyone else in that room.
I was willing to look past my discomfort to unlock that possibility.
At one point during his talk, while walking the aisles, Robbins stood just a few seats away from me.
With my phone out, I looked up at him in awe. He\xe2\x80\x99s a big guy, with an even bigger voice. As he was speaking, there was a moment when we made eye contact. It lasted no more than two seconds, but there was a small voice in my head that said,
\xe2\x80\x9cYou should feel lucky, Gillian. Tony Robbins just looked at you. He\xe2\x80\x99s a big deal.\xe2\x80\x9d
That turned my stomach the moment that thought went through my mind \xe2\x80\x94 an hour before, I barely even know who this guy was. Now, I was trying to convince myself that I should feel honoured that he made eye contact with me?
What the f*ck was happening to me?
But still, I admit that part of my felt special in that moment. So special that I posted the video of the moment we made eye contact on Instagram, and expressed how lucky I felt that Tony Robbins looked at me \xe2\x80\x94 why?
Because my friend and others around me told me that I should feel lucky.
And I believed them.
I came home from the trip on an overall positive tone, and gushed to a friend of mine about the conference.
After talking about Rachel Hollis, I then described my split-second moment with Tony Robbins.
My friend\xc2\xa0made\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0face. I asked what was wrong. She replied,
\xe2\x80\x9cI saw your Instagram post, and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but cringe. I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming you don\xe2\x80\x99t know, Gilly\xe2\x80\xa6 but Tony Robbins has been accused of sexual assault, and harassment. A lot.\xe2\x80\x9d
My blood ran cold.
My excitement was instantly replaced by shame. As a survivor of sexual assault, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that can change my opinion of someone more than learning that they too have attacked another human being, and violated someone in the same way I was.
I immediately started my own research project to get some answers to my probing questions, and found resources such as the following:

www.buzzfeednews.com
What I found was disturbing, to say the least. And so, my inner dialogue began to chastise me:
\xe2\x80\x9cI financially supported this guy? I paid to spend 4 hours in a room with an accused abuser? And my role model/supposed supporter of women Rachel Hollis still speaks at his events knowing this?\xe2\x80\x9d
The entire tone of my trip changed\xc2\xa0from\xc2\xa0there.
It was time to face the facts \xe2\x80\x94 I was duped by two notable people of social influence, and they were now $1,000 richer because of me.
The idea made me entirely sick.
That split-second moment, when Tony Robbins and I shared eye contact \xe2\x80\x94 that feeling of validation and being \xe2\x80\x9cspecial\xe2\x80\x9d was so damn strong.
I know it sounds foolish, but that\xe2\x80\x99s how I truly felt.
Now imagine that split second moment extended into hours of attention by a powerful and notable man.
It\xe2\x80\x99s all too easy for power like that to be used for personal or selfish gain\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94 say, a young woman Tony Robbins has taken under his wing in the name of mentorship.
It\xe2\x80\x99s utterly frightening.
Particularly because Robbins has been abusing his social influence for decades, and has yet to be formally held accountable\xc2\xa0by\xc2\xa0any\xc2\xa0justice\xc2\xa0system.
For me, that answer is fairly simple.
I believe the survivor who has bravely stepped forward to voice the details of their assault.
I myself am a survivor of sexual assault \xe2\x80\x94 I believe victims who come forward.
Do I have a strong bias in that case? Sure\xe2\x80\x94 but statistics back up just how reasonable it is to believe survivors from the get-go.
Statistically, only 5% of sexual assault allegations are false. That means there\xe2\x80\x99s a 95% likelihood that the accusations will hold truth in them.
Furthermore, my belief in victims goes far beyond statistics.
There is no gain or 15-minutes of fame in stepping forward with accusations like this. Survivors are dragged through the mud the minute they raise their voices. They are immediately met with suspicion, and their entire identity is picked apart in a cruel display of theatrical misogyny.
Survivors who step forward to get justice for the violation against them are retraumatized by society and the justice system for doing so.
There is an incredible amount to lose by accusing another of sexual assault \xe2\x80\x94 that is exactly why many, just like me, never file a police report against their attacker. Statistics show that 95% of survivors of sexual assault do not report their attack, for a variety of complex and traumatic personal reasons.
And that risk is only amplified the more notable and prominent the accused is.
Statistically, only 5 out of 1,000 assaulters will be prosecuted and incarcerated for their sexual assault and violation of another human being. The other 995 attackers will walk free.
When Harvey Weinstein received 24 years for his crimes, I wept tears of joy. A sentence of that size never happens \xe2\x80\x94 especially not to a prominent figure.
That was a massive win for the entire survivor community.
But there is still plenty of work to be done \xe2\x80\x94 especially when we consider 95% of sexual assaults go unreported to begin with.
Every survivor has their own reasons\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94 just as they have valid reasons for not stepping forward.
Why did Kavanaugh\xe2\x80\x99s victims step forward to make allegations against him? Because in their bravery they were doing what they believed to be their societal duty.
They didn\xe2\x80\x99t want a rapist gaining more power as an individual who would be a defining voice in deciding what was just and what was not.
Very seldom is it in pursuit of our own justice that survivors speak out.
More often than not, survivors step forward because they want their attacker to be stopped.
They don\xe2\x80\x99t want another innocent soul to become a victim, and have to live with the same violation and life-long trauma they do.
Just as Tony Robbins\xe2\x80\x99 high school victim did, by stepping forward with her own story. Because she knows that if it had happened to her, then it had happened to many more who remain silent to this day.
And she wanted us all to know that, in this trauma and journey of healing, we are not alone.
