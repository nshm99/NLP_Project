Mark Halperin wants his career back. The political pundit and author, fired in 2017 after a dozen women accused him of sexual misconduct, has been busy working on a new book, launching his blog, and conducting radio interviews. He even wants to get back on television \xe2\x80\x94 but on that front, he was stymied by his ex-boss, MSNBC network chief Phil Griffin.
Despite Halperin\xe2\x80\x99s attempted push back into the public eye, said public hasn\xe2\x80\x99t shown much interest. The strategists who lent their names to his book have now expressed regret, and the backlash against his media appearances and blog continue unabated.
Perhaps no one is eager to see Halperin back in politics because of the severity and number of accusations against him: The Game Change author was accused of pressing his erect penis against multiple women, grabbing a woman\xe2\x80\x99s breasts, masturbating in front of a colleague, throwing a woman against a window and, when rejected, calling a woman to tell her she\xe2\x80\x99d never work in media again.
Or maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s because Halperin isn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x94 and never was \xe2\x80\x94 that amazing at his job. In the two years since he\xe2\x80\x99s been out of sight, no one has bemoaned the lack of his voice or work. There\xe2\x80\x99s been no great gaping hole of political analysis in his absence.
The country went on without him, and we\xe2\x80\x99re just fine.
There is genius and talent around every corner \xe2\x80\x94 plenty of it nonwhite and nonmale, even!
The same could be said for most of the men outed as abusers these last few years. Despite fears that the exits of people like Charlie Rose or Matt Lauer would create some broader cultural loss, these supposed vanguards have barely been missed.
It seems we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing an unintended benefit of the #MeToo movement: a debunking of the irreplaceable male genius myth.
As #MeToo gained steam, and abusers started to be shunned or fired, some men argued that the world would be the worse for it. In Harper\xe2\x80\x99s, for example, Lionel Shriver wrote that \xe2\x80\x9cthe party that really pays for the new puritanism [is] the arts consumer.\xe2\x80\x9d And in the wake of the accusations against musician Ryan Adams, one columnist warned that if we \xe2\x80\x9cexpect our artists to be paragons,\xe2\x80\x9d that audiences will be \xe2\x80\x9cstuck with a lot of mediocre art.\xe2\x80\x9d
Apparently these creators were so incredible and talented, that the world just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford to lose their work, even if they did sexually harass or abuse others. Men\xe2\x80\x99s accomplishments and potential contributions, it seemed, far outweighed any concerns over women\xe2\x80\x99s safety.
In fact, women barely rated at all. After the New York Review of Books published a piece by Jian Ghomeshi \xe2\x80\x94 the former radio host accused of punching and choking multiple women \xe2\x80\x94 then-editor Ian Buruma responded to criticism by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThe exact nature of his behavior \xe2\x80\x94 how much consent was involved \xe2\x80\x94 I have no idea, nor is it really my concern.\xe2\x80\x9d Buruma was later fired.
For all the words spilled and social capital lost over men we supposedly couldn\xe2\x80\x99t live without, the \xe2\x80\x9carts consumer\xe2\x80\x9d is doing just fine.
Comedy is still funny without watching Louis C.K., and movies are still fantastic without Harvey Weinstein. Everyone is still binge-watching television shows without Les Moonves, and no one is thinking about Ghomeshi when they listen to their morning radio hour.
In part, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s what really scares the men participating in the backlash against #MeToo: It\xe2\x80\x99s not just that they\xe2\x80\x99re worried about being fired, but also that they ultimately won\xe2\x80\x99t be missed.
The truth is there are genius and talent around every corner \xe2\x80\x94 plenty of it nonwhite and nonmale, even! The industries that men were rightfully forced out of have moved on and thrived, oftentimes replacing outed abusers with female employees.
We don\xe2\x80\x99t need to keep harassers on the payroll in order to give the world great art, music, writing, or comedy. Maybe their absence will even allow for new voices \xe2\x80\x94 ones that have traditionally been drowned or forced out.
