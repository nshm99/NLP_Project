This is a speech that I wrote for a local event. I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d post it on Medium because it might help explain some context to white people.
Always fun for us. During the first meeting, I introduced myself by saying that talks about race are emotional.
\xe2\x80\x9cI speak with a lot of emotion,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, \xe2\x80\x9cand sometimes that emotion is anger. That should be allowed, because anger is a valid response to oppression. I\xe2\x80\x99m not angry at you as an individual, but at a system of injustice.\xe2\x80\x9d
Sometime later, a man said that he hoped we could \xe2\x80\x9crise above emotions.\xe2\x80\x9d He wanted an \xe2\x80\x9cintellectual discussion\xe2\x80\x9d using logic so we could \xe2\x80\x9creally get to heart of the matter\xe2\x80\x9d without getting \xe2\x80\x9cderailed by emotions.\xe2\x80\x9d
Now there is a heck of a lot of subtext there, and I really want you to understand it. But I need to lay a bit of foundation. So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to step back in time a bit so I can explain how a guy beating up his cousin a thousand years ago still affects how we act differently in the dining room.
One day, he jumped in a boat with a few hundred of his buddies and crossed the English Channel to pick a fight. That was when Norman France conquered Anglo-Saxon England.
Now when you conquer a people, you gotta make damn sure they know you\xe2\x80\x99re in charge. One of the best ways to do that is to make them speak your language. So French became the official language in England. Royalty spoke it, lawmakers spoke it. English was even outlawed in some areas. The French said their language was refined, proper, and that Anglo-Saxon was a crude, vulgar language of the unwashed rabble.
Total scam, of course. Anglo-Saxon English was just as refined, as beautiful, and it was hella poetic. But Billy and his boys had to convince \xe2\x80\x9cthose people\xe2\x80\x9d that the French were \xe2\x80\x9cbetter.\xe2\x80\x9d After awhile, the people started believing him.
Here\xe2\x80\x99s the crazy thing: We still do.
A damn lot of our words in English come from this period, and pretty much all of them seem\xe2\x80\xa6 more refined, proper. This is why we \xe2\x80\x9cdine\xe2\x80\x9d at a fine restaurant but \xe2\x80\x9ceat\xe2\x80\x9d at a Barbecue. This is why we \xe2\x80\x9cdrink\xe2\x80\x9d a beer, but might \xe2\x80\x9cimbibe\xe2\x80\x9d a 30-year-old bottle of Ch\xc3\xa2teauneuf-du-Pape.
You need this to sink in: A dude makes up a bunch of crap about his cousin\xe2\x80\x99s language to justify three generations of oppression, and a thousand years later we still believe him.
Culture is how we pass information about our world across generations. It\xe2\x80\x99s why our children speak our language, it\xe2\x80\x99s how they learn from us. Culture is why some humans eat with a fork, and some eat with chopsticks. Culture explains why someone standing really close while they talk to you might feel threatening to a European, but comforting to a West African. Culture defines what acceptable volumes are when speaking, and how women are expected to act in social situations.
Culture defines all of our social expectations, but also our social prejudices. Every single thing we do and say, we do and say in the context of our culture.
Now, making a culture normative \xe2\x80\x94 that is, it defines what is \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 is quite useful. The French used it well in England. Another time it was used was when West Africans were brought to this country as chattel slaves.
The society here in America needed a way to justify the enslavement of a people for no other reason than they looked a bit different. Like the Normans, they used culture to do it. Slaves were made to speak English but were forbidden to read and write. In fact, the myth was promoted that they were slow and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even be taught.
White people saw slaves as animals, apes or at best, \xe2\x80\x9clesser humans.\xe2\x80\x9d They expected slaves to work like animals too \xe2\x80\x94 long, hard, and without complaint. Naturally, slaves rebelled, slowing work or feigning sickness. Blacks were seen by everyone as inherently lazy, and lazy Blacks were beaten or killed.
White people expected slaves to be subservient \xe2\x80\x94 a particularly useful tactic since less than a quarter of whites actually owned slaves. Slaves had to do whatever any white person told them to do. This made all whites \xe2\x80\x9cbetter\xe2\x80\x9d than slaves, and supportive of the system.
And there were the sexual controls. White men objectified and raped Black women at will, while promoting the myth that white women\xe2\x80\x99s purity was threatened merely by the gaze of a Black man. This was particularly useful as a means to control both Black men and white women.
All of these prejudices still reside in white culture.
Antonin Scalia said that Blacks \xe2\x80\x9cshould go to slower schools.\xe2\x80\x9d This is a US Supreme Court Justice, folks.
Donald Trump said he believed that \xe2\x80\x9cLaziness is a trait in blacks.\xe2\x80\x9d This is a man running for president!
A vegan activist Twitter account posted a picture comparing slaughtered pigs to lynched Black people. Leslie Jones rocked the Ghostbusters reboot and was immediately compared to an ape by racist trolls. Meanwhile Lena Dunham weaponized her white body against an innocent Black man because she felt insecure.
And apparently countless Black men would not have gotten shot in the back if they had \xe2\x80\x9cjust done what they were told to do.\xe2\x80\x9d
Like thoughtlessly \xe2\x80\x9cdining\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9ceating,\xe2\x80\x9d white people often carry prejudices about slavery without realizing it. That is why the white refrain of \xe2\x80\x9cslavery was a long time ago, get over it\xe2\x80\x9d falls on deaf Black ears. It\xe2\x80\x99s not Black people holding on to slavery, it\xe2\x80\x99s white people, carrying the prejudices in their culture.
It\xe2\x80\x99s a difficult problem to address. To paraphrase George Orwell, white people have prejudices about people of color because American culture has normalized whiteness, but the fact that people of color act \xe2\x80\x9cdifferently\xe2\x80\x9d further entrenches the \xe2\x80\x9cobvious correctness\xe2\x80\x9d of a white cultural norm.
Why is it normal to eat with a fork instead of chopsticks?
Why is it normal for a man to wear a suit to a business meeting instead of a loose, colorfully printed robe?
Why is it normal to sit in a chair instead of on the floor?
Why is a woman in a long gown and a bonnet accepted \xe2\x80\x94 archaic, perhaps, but accepted? Why is a nun wearing a black gown and habit accepted? Why is a woman in a burka and hijab somehow threatening?
Why do we teach the way we do? Write our laws the way we do? In short, why is our society the way it is?
All of these questions have the same answer: Because we live in a Western European society that was built by Western Europeans for Western Europeans to live in. This culture is so normative that most white people never have to think about it or even know it exists, because everything they do naturally fits the norm.
Being normal makes everything else \xe2\x80\x9cabnormal\xe2\x80\x9d
Damn near everything that Black people do is already outside the white norm. Black people talk too loud, they don\xe2\x80\x99t do what they\xe2\x80\x99re told, they \xe2\x80\x9cact out,\xe2\x80\x9d they stand too close, they have weird hair, they dress funny, they shake their butts too much (which is fine if Taylor Swift does it).
When a white person says \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not about race,\xe2\x80\x9d they are pretty much always saying it when a Black person, or a Latino person, or a Muslim person is not acting the way a white European would act or wants them to act.
And so Black women having fun get kicked off a wine tour for \xe2\x80\x9cacting disruptive\xe2\x80\x9d when they were doing the same thing White women do every day. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not about race. If it\xe2\x80\x99s not, then it\xe2\x80\x99s about them not obeying the cultural expectations of white people \xe2\x80\x94 which amounts to the same damn thing.
\xe2\x80\x9cIf you see something, say something\xe2\x80\x9d works really well when everyone looks and acts the same way. When they don\xe2\x80\x99t, you have an Italian mathematician getting kicked off a plane because a white woman is scared he\xe2\x80\x99s an Islamic terrorist.
All this simply because people of color have a different cultural foundation. Because they are not allowed to act within their culture.
If a white person can still \xe2\x80\x9cdine,\xe2\x80\x9d can still carry the European culture of a thousand years ago, then surely a Black person can carry some West African culture of a few hundred years ago. Surely a Muslim can carry the culture of her parents.
This is why I sat in a discussion group on race and was angry that a white man was telling me we should \xe2\x80\x9crise above emotions\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cget to the heart of the matter\xe2\x80\x9d by talking about race intellectually and avoiding emotions.
Why do we need to center a discussion about racism in the white cultural experience? Why do we need to communicate using Western cultural norms? So, we can talk about race, but we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about race the way a Black person carrying West African culture would talk about it? We should avoid their anger and pain? It would be \xe2\x80\x9cbetter\xe2\x80\x9d to talk about it in a way that Western Europeans will be comfortable talking about it?
In other words: \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s make sure everyone is speaking our language and knows who\xe2\x80\x99s in charge.\xe2\x80\x9d
And I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know he was doing it, because he can\xe2\x80\x99t see that white culture is normative. Every single thing white people do and say is done in the context of normative white culture, which they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to think about.
Because everything a person of color does is done while knowing they are not part of normative white culture. We have to think about everything we do and every word we say. Am I saying this too loudly? Do I look like I might be stealing? If I complain about these working conditions, will they call me lazy? Why did this teacher tell me I can\xe2\x80\x99t be an engineer when I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a 3.8 GPA? Why am I being pulled over when I did nothing wrong?
We think about this all the time \xe2\x80\x94 so much that it\xe2\x80\x99s mostly unconscious by the time we\xe2\x80\x99re teenagers. But we don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it because when a conflict comes up with a white person that is \xe2\x80\x9cnot about race,\xe2\x80\x9d it would take too damn long to explain all of this to them. And we\xe2\x80\x99d have to explain it over and over to every white person we meet hoping they will \xe2\x80\x9cget it.\xe2\x80\x9d
And most of the time, they won\xe2\x80\x99t get it. Most of the time, they can\xe2\x80\x99t see their own culture, much less someone else\xe2\x80\x99s, meaning they have no idea what the hell we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about anyway. So either we get angry, or we just close our eyes, nod our heads, and say things like \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, using the Socratic method to talk intellectually would probably be a good way for us to discuss systematic racism.\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, let\xe2\x80\x99s do it your way.\xe2\x80\x9d
