\xe2\x80\x9cWe called the police because she wrecked her room and hit her mom\xe2\x80\xa6 all because we took her phone,\xe2\x80\x9d Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s father explained. He said that when the police arrived that evening, Kelly was distraught and told an officer that she wanted to kill herself. So an ambulance was called, and the 15-year-old was strapped to a gurney, taken to a psychiatric hospital, and monitored for safety before being released. Days after being hospitalized, Kelly was brought to my office by her parents who wanted to get help for their troubled girl.
Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s parents spoke first. They said that their daughter\xe2\x80\x99s hospitalization was the culmination of a yearlong downward spiral spurred by her phone obsession. Kelly had been refusing to spend time with her family or focus on school. Instead, she favored living her life on social media. A previously happy girl and strong student, Kelly had grown angry, sullen, and was now bringing home report cards with sinking grades. Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s parents had tried many times in prior months to set limits on their daughter\xe2\x80\x99s phone use, but she had become increasingly defiant and deceitful, even sneaking on her phone at all hours of the night.
When Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s latest report card revealed a number of failing grades, her parents felt compelled to act. They told Kelly early in the afternoon on the day the police were called that she would need to turn in her phone by 9 p.m. But when the time came, Kelly refused, and a pushing match ensued between her and her parents, concluding in the violent tantrum that led the girl to be hospitalized.
I asked Kelly, who was sitting in a corner, to help me understand her perspective on that evening. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond and instead glared at her parents. But then, surprising everyone in the room, she cried, \xe2\x80\x9cThey took my f***ing phone!\xe2\x80\x9d Attempting to engage Kelly in conversation, I asked her what she liked about her phone and social media. \xe2\x80\x9cThey make me happy,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied.
As Kelly and her family continued their appointments with me in the coming months, two concerns dominated our meetings. The first was that Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s unhealthy attachment to her phone continued, causing almost constant tension at home. The second concern emerged during my meetings with Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s parents alone. Even though they were loving and involved parents, Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s mom couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help feeling that they\xe2\x80\x99d failed their daughter and must have done something terribly wrong that led to her problems.
My practice as a child and adolescent psychologist is filled with families like Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s. These parents say their kids\xe2\x80\x99 extreme overuse of phones, video games, and social media is the most difficult parenting issue they face \xe2\x80\x94 and, in many cases, is tearing the family apart. Preteen and teen girls refuse to get off their phones, even though it\xe2\x80\x99s remarkably clear that the devices are making them miserable. I also see far too many boys whose gaming obsessions lead them to forgo interest in school, extracurricular activities, and anything else productive. Some of these boys, as they reach their later teens, use their large bodies to terrorize parents who attempt to set gaming limits. A common thread running through many of these cases is parent guilt, as so many are certain they did something to put their kids on a destructive path.
What none of these parents understand is that their children\xe2\x80\x99s and teens\xe2\x80\x99 destructive obsession with technology is the predictable consequence of a virtually unrecognized merger between the tech industry and psychology. This alliance pairs the consumer tech industry\xe2\x80\x99s immense wealth with the most sophisticated psychological research, making it possible to develop social media, video games, and phones with drug-like power to seduce young users.
These parents have no idea that lurking behind their kids\xe2\x80\x99 screens and phones are a multitude of psychologists, neuroscientists, and social science experts who use their knowledge of psychological vulnerabilities to devise products that capture kids\xe2\x80\x99 attention for the sake of industry profit. What these parents and most of the world have yet to grasp is that psychology \xe2\x80\x94 a discipline that we associate with healing \xe2\x80\x94 is now being used as a weapon against children.
Nestled in an unremarkable building on the Stanford University campus in Palo Alto, California, is the Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab, founded in 1998. The lab\xe2\x80\x99s creator, Dr. B.J. Fogg, is a psychologist and the father of persuasive technology, a discipline in which digital machines and apps \xe2\x80\x94 including smartphones, social media, and video games \xe2\x80\x94 are configured to alter human thoughts and behaviors. As the lab\xe2\x80\x99s website boldly proclaims: \xe2\x80\x9cMachines designed to change humans.\xe2\x80\x9d
Fogg speaks openly of the ability to use smartphones and other digital devices to change our ideas and actions: \xe2\x80\x9cWe can now create machines that can change what people think and what people do, and the machines can do that autonomously.\xe2\x80\x9d Called \xe2\x80\x9cthe millionaire maker,\xe2\x80\x9d Fogg has groomed former students who have used his methods to develop technologies that now consume kids\xe2\x80\x99 lives. As he recently touted on his personal website, \xe2\x80\x9cMy students often do groundbreaking projects, and they continue having impact in the real world after they leave Stanford\xe2\x80\xa6 For example, Instagram has influenced the behavior of over 800 million people. The co-founder was a student of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d
Intriguingly, there are signs that Fogg is feeling the heat from recent scrutiny of the use of digital devices to alter behavior. His boast about Instagram, which was present on his website as late as January of 2018, has been removed. Fogg\xe2\x80\x99s website also has lately undergone a substantial makeover, as he now seems to go out of his way to suggest his work has benevolent aims, commenting, \xe2\x80\x9cI teach good people how behavior works so they can create products & services that benefit everyday people around the world.\xe2\x80\x9d Likewise, the Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab website optimistically claims, \xe2\x80\x9cPersuasive technologies can bring about positive changes in many domains, including health, business, safety, and education. We also believe that new advances in technology can help promote world peace in 30 years.\xe2\x80\x9d
While Fogg emphasizes persuasive design\xe2\x80\x99s sunny future, he is quite indifferent to the disturbing reality now: that hidden influence techniques are being used by the tech industry to hook and exploit users for profit. His enthusiastic vision also conveniently neglects to include how this generation of children and teens, with their highly malleable minds, is being manipulated and hurt by forces unseen.
If you haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard of persuasive technology, that\xe2\x80\x99s no accident \xe2\x80\x94 tech corporations would prefer it to remain in the shadows, as most of us don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be controlled and have a special aversion to kids being manipulated for profit. Persuasive technology (also called persuasive design) works by deliberately creating digital environments that users feel fulfill their basic human drives \xe2\x80\x94 to be social or obtain goals \xe2\x80\x94 better than real-world alternatives. Kids spend countless hours in social media and video game environments in pursuit of likes, \xe2\x80\x9cfriends,\xe2\x80\x9d game points, and levels \xe2\x80\x94 because it\xe2\x80\x99s stimulating, they believe that this makes them happy and successful, and they find it easier than doing the difficult but developmentally important activities of childhood.
While persuasion techniques work well on adults, they are particularly effective at influencing the still-maturing child and teen brain. \xe2\x80\x9cVideo games, better than anything else in our culture, deliver rewards to people, especially teenage boys,\xe2\x80\x9d says Fogg. \xe2\x80\x9cTeenage boys are wired to seek competency. To master our world and get better at stuff. Video games, in dishing out rewards, can convey to people that their competency is growing, you can get better at something second by second.\xe2\x80\x9d And it\xe2\x80\x99s persuasive design that\xe2\x80\x99s helped convince this generation of boys they are gaining \xe2\x80\x9ccompetency\xe2\x80\x9d by spending countless hours on game sites, when the sad reality is they are locked away in their rooms gaming, ignoring school, and not developing the real-world competencies that colleges and employers demand.
Likewise, social media companies use persuasive design to prey on the age-appropriate desire for preteen and teen kids, especially girls, to be socially successful. This drive is built into our DNA, since real-world relational skills have fostered human evolution. The Huffington Post article, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Really Happens On a Teen Girl\xe2\x80\x99s iPhone\xe2\x80\x9d describes the life of 14-year-old Casey from Millburn, New Jersey. With 580 friends on Instagram and 1,110 on Facebook, she\xe2\x80\x99s preoccupied with the number of \xe2\x80\x9clikes\xe2\x80\x9d her Facebook profile picture receives compared with her peers. As she says, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t get 100 \xe2\x80\x98likes,\xe2\x80\x99 you make other people share it so you get 100\xe2\x80\xa6. Or else you just get upset. Everyone wants to get the most \xe2\x80\x98likes.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s like a popularity contest.\xe2\x80\x9d
Article author Bianca Bosker says that there are costs to Casey\xe2\x80\x99s phone obsession, noting that the \xe2\x80\x9cgirl\xe2\x80\x99s phone, be it Facebook, Instagram or iMessage, is constantly pulling her away from her homework, sleep, or conversations with her family.\xe2\x80\x9d Casey says she wishes she could put her phone down. But she can\xe2\x80\x99t. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll wake up in the morning and go on Facebook just\xe2\x80\xa6 because,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not like I want to or I don\xe2\x80\x99t. I just go on it. I\xe2\x80\x99m, like, forced to. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why. I need to. Facebook takes up my whole life.\xe2\x80\x9d
B.J. Fogg may not be a household name, but Fortune Magazine calls him a \xe2\x80\x9cNew Guru You Should Know,\xe2\x80\x9d and his research is driving a worldwide legion of user experience (UX) designers who utilize and expand upon his models of persuasive design. As Forbes Magazine writer Anthony Wing Kosner notes, \xe2\x80\x9cNo one has perhaps been as influential on the current generation of user experience (UX) designers as Stanford researcher B.J. Fogg.\xe2\x80\x9d
UX designers come from many disciplines, including psychology as well as brain and computer sciences. However, the core of some UX research is about using psychology to take advantage of our human vulnerabilities. That\xe2\x80\x99s particularly pernicious when the targets are children. As Fogg is quoted in Kosner\xe2\x80\x99s Forbes article, \xe2\x80\x9cFacebook, Twitter, Google, you name it, these companies have been using computers to influence our behavior.\xe2\x80\x9d However, the driving force behind behavior change isn\xe2\x80\x99t computers. \xe2\x80\x9cThe missing link isn\xe2\x80\x99t the technology, it\xe2\x80\x99s psychology,\xe2\x80\x9d says Fogg.
UX researchers not only often follow Fogg\xe2\x80\x99s design model, but some may also share his apparent tendency to overlook the broader implications of persuasive design. They focus on the task at hand, building digital machines and apps that better demand users\xe2\x80\x99 attention, compel users to return again and again, and grow businesses\xe2\x80\x99 bottom line. Less considered can be how the world\xe2\x80\x99s children are affected by thousands of UX designers working simultaneously to pull them onto a multitude of digital devices and products at the expense of real life.
According to B.J. Fogg, the \xe2\x80\x9cFogg Behavior Model\xe2\x80\x9d is a well-tested method to change behavior and, in its simplified form, involves three primary factors: motivation, ability, and triggers. Describing how his formula is effective at getting people to use a social network, the psychologist says in an academic paper that a key motivator is users\xe2\x80\x99 desire for \xe2\x80\x9csocial acceptance,\xe2\x80\x9d although he says an even more powerful motivator is the desire \xe2\x80\x9cto avoid being socially rejected.\xe2\x80\x9d Regarding ability, Fogg suggests that digital products should be made so that users don\xe2\x80\x99t have to \xe2\x80\x9cthink hard.\xe2\x80\x9d Hence, social networks are designed for ease of use. Finally, Fogg says that potential users need to be triggered to use a site. This is accomplished by a myriad of digital tricks, including the sending of incessant notifications urging users to view friends\xe2\x80\x99 pictures, telling them they are missing out while not on the social network, or suggesting that they check \xe2\x80\x94 yet again \xe2\x80\x94 to see if anyone liked their post or photo.
Fogg\xe2\x80\x99s formula is the blueprint for building multibillion dollar social media and gaming companies. However, moral questions about the impact of turning persuasive techniques on children and teens are not being asked. For example, should the fear of social rejection be used to compel kids to compulsively use social media? Is it okay to lure kids away from school tasks that demand a strong mental effort so they can spend their lives on social networks or playing video games that don\xe2\x80\x99t make them think much at all? And is it okay to incessantly trigger kids to use revenue-producing digital products at the expense of engaging with family and other important real-life activities?
Persuasive technologies work because of their apparent triggering of the release of dopamine, a powerful neurotransmitter involved in reward, attention, and addiction. In the Venice region of Los Angeles, now dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cSilicon Beach,\xe2\x80\x9d the startup Dopamine Labs boasts about its use of persuasive techniques to increase profits: \xe2\x80\x9cConnect your app to our Persuasive AI [Artificial Intelligence] and lift your engagement and revenue up to 30% by giving your users our perfect bursts of dopamine,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cA burst of Dopamine doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just feel good: it\xe2\x80\x99s proven to re-wire user behavior and habits.\xe2\x80\x9d
Ramsay Brown, the founder of Dopamine Labs, says in a KQED Science article, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have now developed a rigorous technology of the human mind, and that is both exciting and terrifying. We have the ability to twiddle some knobs in a machine learning dashboard we build, and around the world hundreds of thousands of people are going to quietly change their behavior in ways that, unbeknownst to them, feel second-nature but are really by design.\xe2\x80\x9d Programmers call this \xe2\x80\x9cbrain hacking,\xe2\x80\x9d as it compels users to spend more time on sites even though they mistakenly believe it\xe2\x80\x99s strictly due to their own conscious choices.
Social networks and video games use the trusted brain-manipulation technique of variable reward (think slot machine). Users never know when they will get the next \xe2\x80\x9clike\xe2\x80\x9d or game reward, and it\xe2\x80\x99s delivered at the perfect time to foster maximal stimulation and keep them on the site. Banks of computers employ AI to \xe2\x80\x9clearn\xe2\x80\x9d which of a countless number of persuasive design elements will keep users hooked. A persuasion profile of a particular user\xe2\x80\x99s unique vulnerabilities is developed in real time and exploited to keep users on the site and make them return again and again for longer periods of time. This drives up profits for consumer internet companies whose revenue is based on how much their products are used.
Clandestine techniques that manipulate users to fulfill a profit motive are regarded by programmers as \xe2\x80\x9cdark design.\xe2\x80\x9d Why would firms resort to such tactics? As former tech executive Bill Davidow says in his Atlantic article \xe2\x80\x9cExploiting the Neuroscience of Internet Addiction,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe leaders of Internet companies face an interesting, if also morally questionable, imperative: either they hijack neuroscience to gain market share and make large profits, or they let competitors do that and run away with the market.\xe2\x80\x9d
There are few industries as cutthroat and unregulated as Silicon Valley. Social media and video game companies believe they are compelled to use persuasive technology in the arms race for attention, profits, and survival. Children\xe2\x80\x99s well-being is not part of the decision calculus.
While social media and video game companies have been surprisingly successful at hiding their use of persuasive design from the public, one breakthrough occurred in 2017 when Facebook documents were leaked to The Australian. The internal report crafted by Facebook executives showed the social network boasting to advertisers that by monitoring posts, interactions, and photos in real time, the network is able to track when teens feel \xe2\x80\x9cinsecure,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cworthless,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cstressed,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cuseless\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9cfailure.\xe2\x80\x9d Why would the social network do this? The report also bragged about Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s ability to micro-target ads down to \xe2\x80\x9cmoments when young people need a confidence boost.\xe2\x80\x9d
Persuasive technology\xe2\x80\x99s use of digital media to target children, deploying the weapon of psychological manipulation at just the right moment, is what makes it so powerful. These design techniques provide tech corporations a window into kids\xe2\x80\x99 hearts and minds to measure their particular vulnerabilities, which can then be used to control their behavior as consumers. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t some strange future\xe2\x80\xa6 this is now. Facebook claimed the leaked report was misrepresented in the press. But when child advocates called on the social network to release it, the company refused to do so, preferring to keep the techniques it uses to influence kids shrouded in secrecy.
The official tech industry line is that persuasive technologies are used to make products more engaging and enjoyable. But the revelations of industry insiders can reveal darker motives. Video game developer John Hopson, who has a Ph.D. in behavioral and brain science, wrote the paper \xe2\x80\x9cBehavioral Game Design.\xe2\x80\x9d He describes the use of design features to alter video game player behavior, sounding much like an experimenter running lab animals through their paces, answering questions such as: \xe2\x80\x9cHow do we make players maintain a high, consistent rate of activity?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHow to make players play forever.\xe2\x80\x9d
Revealing the hard science behind persuasive technology, Hopson says, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not to say that players are the same as rats, but that there are general rules of learning which apply equally to both.\xe2\x80\x9d After penning the paper, Hopson was hired by Microsoft, where he helped lead the development of the Xbox Live, Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s online gaming system. He also assisted in the development of Xbox games popular with kids, including those in the Halo series. The parents I work with simply have no idea about the immense amount of financial and psychological firepower aimed at their children to keep them playing video games \xe2\x80\x9cforever.\xe2\x80\x9d
Another persuasive technology expert is Bill Fulton, a game designer who trained in cognitive and quantitative psychology. He started Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s Games User-Research group before founding his own consulting agency. Fulton is transparent about the power of persuasive design and the intent of the gaming industry, disclosing in Big Four Accounting Firm PwC\xe2\x80\x99s tech business journal: \xe2\x80\x9cIf game designers are going to pull a person away from every other voluntary social activity or hobby or pastime, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to engage that person at a very deep level in every possible way they can.\xe2\x80\x9d
This is a major effect of persuasive design today: building video games and social media products so compelling that they pull users away from the real world to spend their lives in for-profit domains. But to engage in a pursuit at the expense of important real-world activities is a core element of addiction. And there is increasing evidence that persuasive design has now become so potent that it is capable of contributing to video game and internet addictions \xe2\x80\x94 diagnoses that are officially recognized in China, South Korea, and Japan, and which are under consideration in the U.S.
Not only does persuasive design appear to drive kids\xe2\x80\x99 addictions to devices, but knowledge of addiction is used to make persuasive design more effective at hijacking the mind. As Dopamine Labs\xe2\x80\x99 Ramsay Brown acknowledges in an episode of CBS\xe2\x80\x99s 60 Minutes, \xe2\x80\x9cSince we\xe2\x80\x99ve figured to some extent how these pieces of the brain that handle addiction are working, people have figured out how to juice them further and how to bake that information into apps.\xe2\x80\x9d
The creation of digital products with drug-like effects that are able to \xe2\x80\x9cpull a person away\xe2\x80\x9d from engaging in real-life activities is the reason why persuasive technology is profoundly destructive. Today, persuasive design is likely distracting adults from driving safely, productive work, and engaging with their own children \xe2\x80\x94 all matters which need urgent attention. Still, because the child and adolescent brain is more easily controlled than the adult mind, the use of persuasive design is having a much more hurtful impact on kids.
Persuasive technologies are reshaping childhood, luring kids away from family and schoolwork to spend more and more of their lives sitting before screens and phones. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation report, younger U.S. children now spend 5 \xc2\xbd hours each day with entertainment technologies, including video games, social media, and online videos. Even more, the average teen now spends an incredible 8 hours each day playing with screens and phones. Productive uses of technology \xe2\x80\x94 where persuasive design is much less a factor \xe2\x80\x94 are almost an afterthought, as U.S. kids only spend 16 minutes each day using the computer at home for school.
Quietly, using screens and phones for entertainment has become the dominant activity of childhood. Younger kids spend more time engaging with entertainment screens than they do in school, and teens spend even more time playing with screens and phones than they do sleeping. The result is apparent in restaurants, the car sitting next to you at the stoplight, and even many classrooms: Attesting to the success of persuasive technology, kids are so taken with their phones and other devices that they have turned their backs to the world around them. Hiding in bedrooms on devices, or consumed by their phones in the presence of family, many children are missing out on real-life engagement with family and school \xe2\x80\x94 the two cornerstones of childhood that lead them to grow up happy and successful. Even during the few moments kids have away from their devices, they are often preoccupied with one thought: getting back on them.
In addition to the displacement of healthy childhood activities, persuasive technologies are pulling kids into often toxic digital environments. A too frequent experience for many is being cyberbullied, which increases their risk of skipping school and considering suicide. And there is growing recognition of the negative impact of FOMO, or the fear of missing out, as kids spend their social media lives watching a parade of peers who look to be having a great time without them, feeding their feelings of loneliness and being less than.
The combined effects of the displacement of vital childhood activities and exposure to unhealthy online environments is wrecking a generation. In her recent Atlantic article, \xe2\x80\x9cHave Smartphones Destroyed a Generation?,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Jean Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University, describes how long hours spent on smartphones and social media are driving teen girls in the U.S. to experience high rates of depression and suicidal behaviors.
And as the typical age when kids get their first smartphone has fallen to 10, it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise to see serious psychiatric problems \xe2\x80\x94 once the domain of teens \xe2\x80\x94 now enveloping young kids. Self-inflicted injuries, such as cutting, that are serious enough to require treatment in an emergency room, have increased dramatically in 10- to 14-year-old girls, up 19% per year since 2009.
While girls are pulled onto smartphones and social media, boys are more likely to be seduced into the world of video gaming, often at the expense of a focus on school. High amounts of gaming are linked to lower grades, so with boys gaming more than girls, it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise to see this generation of boys struggling to make it to college: a full 57% of college admissions are granted to young women compared with only 43% to young men. And, as boys transition to manhood, they can\xe2\x80\x99t shake their gaming habits. Economists working with the National Bureau of Economic Research recently demonstrated how many young U.S. men are choosing to play video games rather than join the workforce.
As a child and adolescent psychologist myself, the inevitable conclusion is both embarrassing and heartbreaking. The destructive forces of psychology deployed by the tech industry are making a greater impact on kids than the positive uses of psychology by mental health providers and child advocates. Put plainly, the science of psychology is hurting kids more than helping them.
Hope for this wired generation has seemed dim until recently, when a surprising group has come forward to criticize the tech industry\xe2\x80\x99s use of psychological manipulation: tech executives. Tristan Harris, formerly a design ethicist at Google, has led the way by unmasking the industry\xe2\x80\x99s use of persuasive design. Interviewed in The Economist\xe2\x80\x99s 1843 magazine, he says, \xe2\x80\x9cThe job of these companies is to hook people, and they do that by hijacking our psychological vulnerabilities.\xe2\x80\x9d
Another tech exec raising red flags about his tech industry\xe2\x80\x99s use of mind manipulation is former Facebook president Sean Parker. Interviewed in Axios, he discloses: \xe2\x80\x9cThe thought process that went into building these applications, Facebook being the first of them\xe2\x80\xa6 was all about: \xe2\x80\x98How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d He also said that Facebook exploits \xe2\x80\x9cvulnerability in human psychology\xe2\x80\x9d and remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cGod only knows what it\xe2\x80\x99s doing to our children\xe2\x80\x99s brains.\xe2\x80\x9d
A theme advanced by these tech execs is that the industry is unfairly using persuasive technology to gain a profit advantage. \xe2\x80\x9cConsumer internet businesses are about exploiting psychology,\xe2\x80\x9d Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook VP says in a talk ironically given at B.J. Fogg\xe2\x80\x99s Stanford University. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to psychologically figure out how to manipulate you as fast as possible and then give you back that dopamine hit.\xe2\x80\x9d
Having children of their own can change tech execs\xe2\x80\x99 perspective. Tony Fadell, formerly at Apple, is considered the father of the iPad and also of much of the iPhone. He is also the founder and current CEO of Nest. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of the designers and coders who were in their 20s when we were creating these things didn\xe2\x80\x99t have kids. Now they have kids,\xe2\x80\x9d Fadell remarks, while speaking at the Design Museum in London. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they see what\xe2\x80\x99s going on, and they say, \xe2\x80\x98Wait a second.\xe2\x80\x99 And they start to rethink their design decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d
Marc Benioff, CEO of the cloud computing company Salesforce, is one of the voices calling for the regulation of social media companies because of their potential to addict children. He says that just as the cigarette industry has been regulated, so too should social media companies. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that, for sure, technology has addictive qualities that we have to address, and that product designers are working to make those products more addictive, and we need to rein that back as much as possible,\xe2\x80\x9d Benioff told CNBC in January, 2018, while in Davos, Switzerland, site of the World Economic Forum.
Benioff says that parents should do their part to limit their kids\xe2\x80\x99 devices, yet expressed, \xe2\x80\x9cIf there\xe2\x80\x99s an unfair advantage or things that are out there that are not understood by parents, then the government\xe2\x80\x99s got to come forward and illuminate that.\xe2\x80\x9d Since millions of parents, for example the parents of my patient Kelly, have absolutely no idea that devices are used to hijack their children\xe2\x80\x99s minds and lives, regulation of such practices is the right thing to do.
Another improbable group to speak out on behalf of children is tech investors. Major Apple stockholders \xe2\x80\x94 the hedge fund Jana Partners and California State Teachers\xe2\x80\x99 Retirement System, which collectively own $2 billion in the firm\xe2\x80\x99s stock \xe2\x80\x94 have recently raised concerns that persuasive design is contributing to kids\xe2\x80\x99 suffering. In an open letter to Apple, the investors, teaming up with leading child technology experts, detailed evidence that kids\xe2\x80\x99 overuse of phones and devices is leading to their increased risk of depression and suicide risk factors. Specifically calling out the destructive impact of persuasive technology, the letter reads: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is also no secret that social media sites and applications for which the iPhone and iPad are a primary gateway are usually designed to be as addictive and time-consuming as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d
How has the consumer tech industry responded to these calls for change? By going even lower. Facebook recently launched Messenger Kids, a social media app that will reach kids as young as five years old. Suggestive that harmful persuasive design is now honing in on very young children is the declaration of Messenger Kids Art Director, Shiu Pei Luu, \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to help foster communication [on Facebook] and make that the most exciting thing you want to be doing.\xe2\x80\x9d
Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s narrow-minded vision of childhood is reflective of how out of touch the social network and other consumer tech companies are with the needs of an increasingly troubled generation. The most \xe2\x80\x9cexciting thing\xe2\x80\x9d for young children should be spending time with family, playing outside, engaging in creative play, and other vital developmental experiences \xe2\x80\x94 not being drawn into the social media vortex on phones or tablets. Moreover, Facebook Messenger Kids is giving an early start to the wired life on social media that we know poses risks of depression and suicide-related behavior for older children.
In response to the release of Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s Messenger Kids, the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC) sent Facebook a letter signed by numerous health advocates calling on the company to pull the plug on the app. Facebook has yet to respond to the letter and instead continues to aggressively market Messenger Kids for young children.
While tech execs and investors are speaking out against the tech industry\xe2\x80\x99s psychological manipulation of children, the American Psychological Association (APA) \xe2\x80\x94 which is tasked with protecting children and families from harmful psychological practices \xe2\x80\x94 has been essentially silent on the matter. This is not suggestive of malice; instead, the APA leadership \xe2\x80\x94 much like parents \xe2\x80\x94 is likely unaware of the tech industry\xe2\x80\x99s distorted use of psychology. Nonetheless, there is irony, as psychologists and their powerful tools are guided by ethics, while tech execs and investors are not.
The Ethics Code of the APA, U.S psychology\xe2\x80\x99s chief professional organization, is quite clear: \xe2\x80\x9cPsychologists strive to benefit those with whom they work and take care to do no harm.\xe2\x80\x9d Moreover, APA Ethical Standards require the profession to make efforts to correct the \xe2\x80\x9cmisuse\xe2\x80\x9d of the work of psychologists, which would include the application of B.J. Fogg\xe2\x80\x99s persuasive technologies to influence children against their best interests. The code even provides special protection to kids because their developmental \xe2\x80\x9cvulnerabilities impair autonomous decision making.\xe2\x80\x9d
Manipulating children for profit without their own or parents\xe2\x80\x99 consent, and driving kids to spend more time on devices that contribute to emotional and academic problems is the embodiment of unethical psychological practice. Silicon Valley corporations and the investment firms that support them are heavily populated by highly privileged white men who use concealed mind-bending techniques to control the lives of defenseless kids. Addressing this inequity is Tristan Harris, who says, \xe2\x80\x9cNever before in history have basically 50 mostly men, mostly 20\xe2\x80\x9335, mostly white engineer designer types within 50 miles of where we are right now [Silicon Valley], had control of what a billion people think and do.\xe2\x80\x9d Harris was recounting an excerpt of a presentation he made while at Google during an interview with journalist Kara Swisher for Recode Decode in February of 2017.
Some may argue that it\xe2\x80\x99s the parents\xe2\x80\x99 responsibility to protect their children from tech industry deception. However, parents have no idea of the powerful forces aligned against them, nor do they know how technologies are developed with drug-like effects to capture kids\xe2\x80\x99 minds. Parents simply can\xe2\x80\x99t protect their children or teens from something that\xe2\x80\x99s concealed and unknown to them.
Others will claim that nothing should be done because the intention behind persuasive design is to build better products, not manipulate kids. In fact, for those working in the user experience and persuasion fields, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure there is no intent to harm children. The negative consequences of persuasive technology have been for the most part accidental, an unfortunate byproduct of an exceptionally competitive design process. However, similar circumstances exist in the cigarette industry, as tobacco companies have as their intention profiting from the sale of their product, not hurting children. Nonetheless, because cigarettes and persuasive design predictably harm children, actions should be taken to protect kids from their effects.
Since its inception, the field of persuasive technology has operated in a moral vacuum. The resulting tragedy is not surprising.
In truth, the harmful potential of using persuasive design has long been recognized. Fogg, himself, says in a 1999 journal article, \xe2\x80\x9cPersuasive computers can also be used for destructive purposes; the dark side of changing attitudes and behaviors leads toward manipulation and coercion.\xe2\x80\x9d And in a 1998 academic paper, Fogg describes what should happen if things go wrong, saying, if persuasive technologies are \xe2\x80\x9cdeemed harmful or questionable in some regard, a researcher should then either take social action or advocate that others do so.\xe2\x80\x9d
More recently, Fogg has actually acknowledged the ill effects of persuasive design. Interviewed by Ian Leslie in 2016 for The Economist\xe2\x80\x99s 1843 Magazine, Fogg says, \xe2\x80\x9cI look at some of my former students and I wonder if they\xe2\x80\x99re really trying to make the world better, or just make money.\xe2\x80\x9d And in 2017 when Fogg was interviewed by 032c Magazine, he acknowledged, \xe2\x80\x9cYou look around the restaurants and pretty much everyone has their phone on the table and they\xe2\x80\x99re just being constantly drawn away from the live face-to-face interaction \xe2\x80\x94 I do think that\xe2\x80\x99s a bad thing.\xe2\x80\x9d Nonetheless, Fogg hasn\xe2\x80\x99t taken meaningful action to help those hurt by the field he fathered. Nor have those in positions of power, with the recent exception of tech execs coming forward, done anything to limit the manipulative and coercive use of digital machines against children and teens.
So, how can children be protected from the tech industry\xe2\x80\x99s use of persuasive design? I suggest turning to President John F. Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s prescient guidance: He said that technology \xe2\x80\x9chas no conscience of its own. Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man.\xe2\x80\x9d I believe that the psychology profession, with its understanding of the mind and ethics code as guidance, can step forward to become a conscience guiding how tech corporations interact with children and teens.
The APA should begin by demanding that the tech industry\xe2\x80\x99s behavioral manipulation techniques be brought out of the shadows and exposed to the light of public awareness. Changes should be made in the APA\xe2\x80\x99s Ethics Code to specifically prevent psychologists from manipulating children using digital machines, especially if such influence is known to pose risks to their well-being. Moreover, the APA should follow its Ethical Standards by making strong efforts to correct the misuse of psychological persuasion by the tech industry and by user experience designers outside the field of psychology.
There is more the psychology profession can and should do to protect children and rectify the harm being done to kids. It should join with tech executives who are demanding that persuasive design in kids\xe2\x80\x99 tech products be regulated. The APA also should make its powerful voice heard amongst the growing chorus calling out tech companies that intentionally exploit children\xe2\x80\x99s vulnerabilities. And the APA must make stronger and bolder efforts to educate parents, schools, and fellow child advocates about the harms of kids\xe2\x80\x99 overuse of digital devices.
With each passing day, new and more influential persuasive technologies are being deployed to better take advantage of children\xe2\x80\x99s and teens\xe2\x80\x99 inherent limitations. The psychology profession must insist in this new age that its tools be used to improve rather than hinder children\xe2\x80\x99s health and well-being. By making a strong statement against the exploitive use of persuasive design, the APA and the psychology profession can help provide the conscience needed to guide us in this age of dangerously powerful digital machines.
