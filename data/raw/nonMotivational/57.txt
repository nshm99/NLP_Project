In a world where everybody\xe2\x80\x99s lives are are a perpetual display of accolades, achievements, and accomplishments, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to continually compare yourself to other people. A few years ago, Chris Brogan said to me \xe2\x80\x9cnobody ever won a race by looking sideways.\xe2\x80\x9d After that, I stopped reading people\xe2\x80\x99s income reports, blog posts about tactics and started to do my work. I started to run my own race and became a much more prolific creator.
I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard a joke that in Silicon Valley if you have 10 million dollars you\xe2\x80\x99re poor because you\xe2\x80\x99re neighbor probably has a 120 million. You can always find someone who has more:
Comparing yourself to people who have more is not going to turn you into one of them. But if you compare less and create more, you might actually become a person who has more.
No matter how much you accumulate, you can\xe2\x80\x99t take any of it with you when you die. As my friend AJ Leon says about, the game of monopoly:
The day I graduated from school, the world handed me a pair of dice and pointed me towards a familiar board game. Except this time instead of a Rolls Royce, I was sporting a busted ass MetroCard. The parameters of this game were simple. Just follow the board, round and round, and the longer I stayed on the board, the more times I could pass Go, the more stupid little green houses I\xe2\x80\x99d get to buy, the more railroads I\xe2\x80\x99d procure \xe2\x80\x94 the more wealth I\xe2\x80\x99d accumulate. All of which would culminate into me turning into a happy rich guy with a white mustache and a top hat.
Of course, soon enough I realized that I was essentially spending the vast majority of my existence rolling the same stupid dice over and over again, following the same board to a completely prescribed life plan, taking no risks, tucking away every dream I ever had, living for the weekend, and peering off the board from time to time, dreaming of the glory of a life that could have been
We seem to forget one of the most important lessons in the game of monopoly: once the game is over it all goes back in the box.
If you don\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate what you have now, you\xe2\x80\x99ll never appreciate what you get later \xe2\x80\x94 Tim Ferriss
Compared to people who walk miles a day to get clean drinking water, everybody reading this has plenty to be grateful for. One of the saddest things I saw a few days ago on Netflix was an episode of the documentary The Beginning of Life. A young Indian girl living in poverty is asked what her biggest dreams were. She said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have any dreams.\xe2\x80\x9d Even if you have dreams that haven\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily come true, you have more than you might be aware of.
One of my favorite sections of Seth Godin\xe2\x80\x99s seminar Leap First is when he talks about money stories. We all have a money story. And he says one way to unwind our stories about money is to become a philanthropist. He tells the story of his friend Sasha Dichter who for months at a time gives money to people on the streets and makes donations to anyone who asks. He concludes the story by saying \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t possibly be a person who tips 20 dollars and on 6 dollar cup of coffee and still have a limiting narrative around money.\xe2\x80\x9d
In his book NO BS Wealth Attraction, Dan Kennedy encourages people to set a percentage of every dollar they receive for saving and for giving:
Giving has an incredible effect on your psyche. So immediately open another bank account and call it your giving account. Also, predetermine a fixed percentage of every dollar that you receive to divert your giving account.
You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be Bill Gates or a billionaire to become a philanthropist. As someone who wants to see changes happen in our education, I\xe2\x80\x99ve loved being able to support teacher projects on DonorsChoose.
We all have a unique destiny in this world. And running your own race is a great way ensure the realization of that destiny and live a much richer and rewarding life. And as my best friend from college always reminded me every time I felt like all my friends were so far ahead of me in life \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do Srini, race to the the death?\xe2\x80\x9d
