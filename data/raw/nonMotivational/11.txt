The FBI went to his high school when the 15 year old Mr. X hacked into the largest Internet company in the world and stole 90 million credit card numbers.
\xe2\x80\x9cYou are going to jail for a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d they told him.
The day after he stole them he sent them back to the company and explained what their cyber security flaws were.
He thought they would thank him.
The FBI came to arrest him. \xe2\x80\x9cI was scared to death,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me when we first met.
The head of the school, a three star general, told them, \xe2\x80\x9cYou guys better get out of here if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t writing this boy a check and saying thank you.\xe2\x80\x9d
They left.
Then.
Two years later when Mr. X graduated he got \xe2\x80\x9cthe call\xe2\x80\x9d. The call that meant he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go to college.
The call that meant he would parachute into enemy fire, hack foreign governments, hack our own computers. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done so many things,\xe2\x80\x9d he once told me. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine.\xe2\x80\x9d
The call from a three initial agency. More than one.
We met at a dinner. We were both obsessed with hacking and the latest flaws in computer security. We ignored every else and spoke for three hours.
And we haven\xe2\x80\x99t stopped talking since.
I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean this to be conspiracy theory. There\xe2\x80\x99s already been rumors about \xe2\x80\x9cfake news\xe2\x80\x9d, election hacking, etc.
There are bot armies. There are hackers taking down electric grids every day. Every company in the Fortune 500 is completely hacked. Your computer is hacked.
I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent many years talking to people in the security space.
The reality is: the war is on.
And it\xe2\x80\x99s being fought with data. And it\xe2\x80\x99s being fought all over the world. And it\xe2\x80\x99s being fought every day.
Not just on election systems. Or at big companies. But on your computer. And the war is not always being fought by the people you expect. The enemeies we were always trained to believe.
Mr. X spent time in special forces. Was in every overseas battle. Has been involved in more news stories than he likes to admit.
He\xe2\x80\x99s also built and sold two companies using his hacking abilities. He lives a good life now and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want his voice e or identity to be revealed.
So we distorted it for the podcast.
I asked him, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you still work for \xe2\x80\x98them\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9c.
He turned away and said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou never stop working for them.\xe2\x80\x9d
The goal of this isn\xe2\x80\x99t to scare people. Information is power.
And this is some of what I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned from Mr. X.
1. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A VOICE, YOU HAVE TO SPEAK
\xe2\x80\x9cIn the past, to go up against an institution, you need to be an institution.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. X said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow more than ever, we need to stand up for what we believe in. We have these powerful, engaging tools to influence others, but we still leave it up to the powers that control us to influence us.
If you believe something, share it.
In other words, don\xe2\x80\x99t let the media \xe2\x80\x9cprogram\xe2\x80\x9d what you believe in. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let the online word \xe2\x80\x9chack\xe2\x80\x9d into your brain. They already know more about you than you know about yourself. And they use that knowledge against you 24 hours a day.
If you want to have a voice, YOU HAVE TO SPEAK.
2. POLICE YOURSELF
We were talking about computer security. He told me all the ways you could be hacked\xe2\x80\xa6 that you would never think of.
\xe2\x80\x9cLet me ask you, when\xe2\x80\x99s the last time you updated your firmware on your router?\xe2\x80\x9d
I had no idea.
\xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99m going in, I\xe2\x80\x99m going through the router,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe majority of the fortune 500 use the same router\xe2\x80\xa6 So you either trust the government to police data OR you need to be that person.\xe2\x80\x9d
And that was just one weakness. Next time you are on your phone check out how many apps on your phone have permission to turn on your video camera and start recording and transmitting what they record without you being aware.
Don\xe2\x80\x99t think they aren\xe2\x80\x99t doing it.
3. HOW DID OSAMA BIN LADEN REALLY DIE?
Was Osama Bin Laden really casually sleeping on the third floor of a building with no access out? Or was he a prisoner and we had lost our use for him?
Mr. X: \xe2\x80\x9che was our prisoner for years. Then we had no use for him.\xe2\x80\x9d
Always question everything the media and the government tells us. Always be a skeptic in a world where it\xe2\x80\x99s not in anyone\xe2\x80\x99s benefit to tell you the truth.
This is not conspiracy theory. The only truth is to trust the people you love. The people who love you.
This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean be irrational or paranoid or come up with crazy theories.
This means practice being a skeptic every day on every issue.
Practice skepticism. Not paranoia.
4. BE VULNERABLE TO GETTING SHUT DOWN
I knew there were millions of questions I wanted to ask\xe2\x80\xa6 but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.
I asked anyway.
\xe2\x80\x9cAre you still involved in the government?\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.
\xe2\x80\x9cWell, which agency were you in?\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say.\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x9cDo people know it?\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x9cYes, let\xe2\x80\x99s just say it\xe2\x80\x99s a well-known 3 letter agency.\xe2\x80\x9d
Ask. Get shut down. Ask again.
When I do an interview, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to harass people for an answer. But sometimes if you poke and prod from various directions while you build rapport, you can get the answer.
Not this time.
5. KNOW WHAT DRIVES YOU
Mr. X started hacking when he was in military school.
Everything was regimented:
wake up
first mess
solute the flag
go to class
second mess
second class
change 15 minutes
go to sports
third mess
after third mess, 2 hours of study hall, one hour of free time
go to sleep
do it all over again
The school is isolated. And the students can\xe2\x80\x99t leave campus.
The only way Mr. X could talk to girls was if he found them online. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were heavily confined,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.
But he kept hitting firewalls.
So he started hacking. He learned everything he could. Not because he wanted to \xe2\x80\x9cattack\xe2\x80\x9d websites. But because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be alone.
Always let the prison walls around you create your opportunities.
Censorship created his curiosity.
What frustrates you that can kickstart your curiosity.
6. LEARN YOUR PATTERNS
Mr. X helped find one of the most well known serial killers in recent years and put him behind bars for life.
Mr. X was paid to find patterns. He watched terrorists. The example: \xe2\x80\x9ca burn phone.\xe2\x80\x9d This is what criminals use to cover their call history. They buy a cheap phone. Call a few people, throw it away and buy a new one.
So Mr. X wrote software.
Someone calls you, then you call 3\xe2\x80\x934 people. Those 3\xe2\x80\x934 people call 3\xe2\x80\x934 more people. It\xe2\x80\x99s a tree of calling. And if they follow the branches then can find the roots.
He analyzed the trees of one billion phone calls a day. He had access to all of our calls.
\xe2\x80\x9cEventually, you realize that if a bunch of random numbers keep calling the same person that all those random numbers are the same guy,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. X said.
People are patterns. Those patterns become your fingerprint.
He used that fingerprint to identify a notorious serial killer. Used GPS to track him down. Now the guy is in jail.
He used those fingerprints to track terrorists. \xe2\x80\x9cThere were a lot of attacks stopped.\xe2\x80\x9d
7. INTERESTS PRECEDE EDUCATION
He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t educated about hacking or even computers. But he was passionate about it and learned everything he could.
\xe2\x80\x9cI found something I was interested in\xe2\x80\xa6 and that was the best education I ever received.\xe2\x80\x9d
Find an interest. List every day the things you were interested in as a kid. It\xe2\x80\x99s never too late to learn now.
The one who loves what he does will always learn faster and better than the person who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t love it.
The one in love will compete better against the one who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.
The one in love will be\xe2\x80\xa6happier.
8. TRUST THE INVISIBLE
\xe2\x80\x9cYou were saving lives,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.
\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\xe2\x80\x9d
But I insisted. Because I feel we all have invisible threads of impact. We help and hurt people in ways we don\xe2\x80\x99t know.
We all have our special abilities. And abilities to help and hurt without realizing. Always be healthy enough to know the difference.
Mr. X got married. Loves his family. Loves his work. \xe2\x80\x9cSome of my ex partners never escaped the mindset wer were programmed with.\xe2\x80\x9d
Reach for the positive when trapped in a negative.
Love someone.
9. CHOOSE YOUR OWN NET WORTH
Mr. X measures his net worth not by dollars, not by accomplishments or promotions. \xe2\x80\x9cMy net worth is now in data,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.
He comes from hacker culture where the core belief is that information should be free.
Too often, we accept what\xe2\x80\x99s been given to us. \xe2\x80\x9cThe rules\xe2\x80\x9d we were told to live by. The standards were set for us\xe2\x80\xa6
But Mr. X proved you can set your own standards. You can choose the measurement of your net worth. Rich in relationships, rich in people, rich in joy, rich in knowledge\xe2\x80\xa6
10. LEARN EVERYTHING YOU CAN
Mr. X found a pattern in his own life. He realized he loved hacking. And he loved detecting patterns. He got the same joy from both.
So he started reading books\xe2\x80\xa6 and learned everything he could about computers, code, internet, backdoors and so on.
He used those abilities to fight wars. Then to help law enforcement track down criminals. And then to build massive companies that he sold.
I met Mr. X with his wife and daughters recently. I had never seen him so happy.
Sometimes the best pattern is the smile of your daughter. At least I think so.
