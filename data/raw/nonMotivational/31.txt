My husband is white and I am black. When I got pregnant, we decided to move to the countryside. We wanted a house with a garden and rent out there was much cheaper. We found a beautiful farmhouse right out of a Town & Country magazine, about 20 kilometers outside Geneva, Switzerland. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t far from where the singer and the Genesis band drummer Phil Collins lived.
The farmhouse was rustic and spacious, with a cozy feel to it. There were numerous hiking trails in the vicinity, and I could already see myself rolling in the hay and living the exciting outdoor life I had always craved. We moved in during my first trimester as I looked forward to a fit pregnancy full of lots of fresh air and walks in the Swiss countryside. I was completely unprepared for how things would turn out.
I should have noticed that despite our house being in the center of the village, surrounded by many other dwellings, no one acknowledged our presence or came out to say \xe2\x80\x9chello\xe2\x80\x9d when we arrived. There were passerby\xe2\x80\x99s for sure, but whenever I tried to make eye contact, they looked away. I put it all up to the fact that we were new and that they needed time to adjust. After a month of being systemically avoided and ignored, I began to realize that there was something wrong.
One evening, my husband and I decided to grab a pizza at the local pizzeria. We figured it would be an opportunity to meet some of our neighbors and eventually make some friends. We entered the noisy restaurant and the entire room fell silent as everyone interrupted whatever they were doing to stare at us. Some seemed surprised and even shocked to see us. Their mouths hung open in bewilderment. There were no amicable looks sent our way. I immediately felt uneasy and apprehensive, and as we walked towards the bar area, I whispered to Oscar:
\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t we order the pizzas to go instead?\xe2\x80\x9d
My husband nodded his approval and placed our order with the waitress.
I felt all the eyes in the room on my back like treacherous daggers, digging in, inflicting inconsolable pain. We calmly took seats to wait for the pizzas but my fight or flight reflexes were fully on alert.
That evening, as we hurriedly walked home in the cool spring air, I felt an immense amount of sadness. Clearly, the people in the village disliked us. We were new, and maybe they didn\xe2\x80\x99t like strangers, but what I had witnessed during those few minutes in the pizzeria, was their hatred. It was the type steeped only in deep racism and hatred of blackness.
We had only lived there for a month and weren\xe2\x80\x99t ready to move out just so soon so we decided to stick it out. We decided that we would try and win over the villagers. For months, we tried to socialize with the community: we engaged with the mailman when he came around, we attempted to speak to our neighbors, the shopkeepers, and the farmers in the fields but we were ignored or made to feel unwelcome whenever we did. It was a very lonely time for us.
One morning, I saw a lady pushing a pram walk by the house. She was young and I imagined she may be more open-minded than the others. I grabbed my coat and headed out \xe2\x80\x94 following her discreetly. She went toward an easy walking trail and I accelerated my pace until we were soon walking side by side.
\xe2\x80\x9cGood day,\xe2\x80\x9d I said politely.
\xe2\x80\x9cHello,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, a shy smile on her face.
\xe2\x80\x9cWe just moved here, and haven\xe2\x80\x99t met many people.\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen you and your husband. I must tell you, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the best place for interracial couples, people are very close-minded here, most don\xe2\x80\x99t like black people.\xe2\x80\x9d
My heart sank. I mean I had suspected this all along, but actually getting confirmation of it was disappointing. Somehow, I secretly hoped that what I had felt about the place was wrong. I mean it was such a beautiful village, yet at the heart of all that beauty lay racism, the most deplorable form of ugliness.
Rosemarie and I got to know each other better but we never quite became friends. I had a feeling she simply tolerated me.
My pregnancy progressed and in my last trimester, I had a few complications and was put on bed rest for 6 hours a day. I drove to work every morning and returned home at lunchtime. Every day, I would walk through the village heavily pregnant, overdosing on emotional pregnancy hormones and no one ever said hello to me. I felt emotionally depleted, saddened by the ugliness of exclusion and racism. I thought of the innocent child that I was bringing into this racist world and often cried.
As though to compensate for all the nastiness and racism we faced, my husband spoilt me immensely throughout my pregnancy. I remember having a craving for salad, litchis, and vanilla milkshakes \xe2\x80\x94 not all at the same time \xe2\x80\x94 and he would go out of his way to find them for me.
On January 31, 2001, my water broke, and we went to the hospital in the larger village of Nyon, which was about 10 kilometers away. It was a lot more international there and the hospital staff was kind. I secretly hoped that when we returned to our village with the baby, people would be curious or more accepting of us. I realize now that that was too much to ask.
Once back home with our son, I took every opportunity to take him on long walks. The motion usually made him fall asleep quite fast. I crossed many of the villagers but none tried to be friendly or express any curiosity. Three months later, we moved back to Geneva with our baby. We couldn't take it anymore. We moved back to the diverse, multicultural environment we knew, the place that had always accepted us.
Often, my white friends who live in the countryside ask why we live a stone\xe2\x80\x99s throw away from the city. They say that it\xe2\x80\x99s an expensive place and that we should really re-consider the countryside. I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to explain that as an interracial couple, we don\xe2\x80\x99t really have the freedom to live wherever we want. We need to be sure that the community we live in is an open-minded one that accepts and respects us.
We chose where we want to live with laser-like precision in order to avoid exposing ourselves to an intolerable amount of racism. As I grow older, I know that I won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to cope with racism anymore. It has caused me too much pain and suffering.
And you might argue with that and say: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I can choose to live anywhere I want, but the reality is can I really? Can I? \xe2\x80\x9d
Some places make you feel so unwelcome that it\xe2\x80\x99s not worth the emotional strife and discomfort. So while I too sometimes fool myself by saying, I am free, the reality is that I\xe2\x80\x99m not really that free. Most of the choices in my life are dictated by how much or how little racism I will face living here or living there, doing my grocery shopping here or there, going to the gym here or there, getting a facial here or there.
Many people don\xe2\x80\x99t see racism as being their business. They\xe2\x80\x99ll skim through this article and think:
\xe2\x80\x9cLuckily, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have her life\xe2\x80\x9d.
Racism persists because you think it is someone else\xe2\x80\x99s business and not yours to resolve. But as human beings, we should all strive to make this world a better place, if not for us, for future generations. And one of the ways in which you can do this is to make antiracism your fight too. Simply type antiracism into your search engine and you\xe2\x80\x99ll find a million and one resources to help you on your journey. You too can join this fight to build a nonracist world. Don't wait, get on it right away!
