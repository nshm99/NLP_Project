Whenever you see UN Ambassador Nikki Haley on video she\xe2\x80\x99s trying to start World War Three. At today\xe2\x80\x99s UN Security Council Haley gave remarks about why the UN should \xe2\x80\x9ctake action\xe2\x80\x9d against two of the US power establishment\xe2\x80\x99s favorite targets, Russia and the Syrian government, due to allegations that Bashar al-Assad has been using chemical weapons.
That\xe2\x80\x99s right, just three weeks after the Trump administration unveiled its plan to keep thousands of US troops in Syria in order to force regime change, the tired old chemical weapons allegations have been unearthed and recirculated to trusting western mainstream media audiences.
I am not a Syria expert by any stretch of the imagination. If you want detailed information about what\xe2\x80\x99s really going on in that nation I recommend getting in touch with real Syrians online and following the work of independent investigative journalists who regularly go there like Vanessa Beeley. Nevertheless, despite my lack of boots-on-the-ground expertise and intimate knowledge of every detail of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in that country, I am absolutely certain that the western power establishment is lying very extensively about what is going on in Syria.
One hundred percent certain, zero margin for error. I\xe2\x80\x99d bet my life on it.
How can I be so sure? I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you.
There are many, many, many piles of evidence substantiating the fact that the Syrian government has become the target of what is surely one of the largest and most sophisticated propaganda campaigns in human history, but most people don\xe2\x80\x99t have time to comb through all the tiny details and sort through the complexities of what\xe2\x80\x99s what. For this reason I thought it would be useful to compile a short list for people who, like me, don\xe2\x80\x99t have time to dedicate themselves intimately to the in-depth study of Syria. This list makes it abundantly clear that there is an organized disinformation campaign saturating mainstream narratives about what is happening in Syria, making it therefore impossible to place any faith in the reports that are coming out about that nation\xe2\x80\x99s government today. All you need is a little information and critical thinking.
Without further ado, here are five reasons why you can be as absolutely certain of the mass media\xe2\x80\x99s deception in this area as I am.
I point to this one a lot. If you haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet figured out that mainstream media outlets are tools of outrageous war propaganda, and you watch this interview with your eyes wide open, your jaw will drop to the floor and you will never see the world the same again.
After the highly suspicious and hotly disputed accusations of sarin gas use by the Syrian government in the Idlib province back in April of last year, a little girl was paraded before the CNN audience to condemn Assad and plead for western intervention. Anyone watching the interview can see that it is very obviously scripted, and the little girl is sounding out pre-written syllables in a way that children simply do not speak, using words and concepts that no seven year-old could possibly understand. This is self-evident to anyone who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a vested interest in not seeing it.
Additionally, other video footage from around the same time showed that the girl did not speak English enough to even understand basic questions about what kind of food she likes to eat, instead regurgitating the pre-scripted line \xe2\x80\x9cSave the children of Syria\xe2\x80\x9d in response.
More disturbingly, because this interview was scripted, it means that CNN\xe2\x80\x99s Alisyn Camerota necessarily had the other half of the script the girl was reading from. A prominent newscaster from a top US mainstream media outlet knowingly participated in a fake, scripted interview designed to manufacture support for western military interventionism, and sold it to CNN\xe2\x80\x99s audience as a real interview.
The footage from that fake interview was then re-used by CNN to bully congressman Thomas Massie for his opposition to Syrian interventionism.
Bana and her popular Twitter account have been propped up by countless establishment backers ranging from Time Magazine to Harry Potter author JK Rowling, as well as a lucrative book deal with Simon & Schuster. Her legitimacy has also been ferociously defended by Bellingcat, a neocon propaganda outlet with ties to the Atlantic Council, the same think tank whose Ukraine-tied influence has fingerprints all over the establishment Russia narrative. Bellingcat and its sleazy staff have been loudly sounding the alarm about the new \xe2\x80\x9cchemical weapons\xe2\x80\x9d story throughout online media.
Similar to item number one, independent researcher Robert Stuart has shown conclusively how the world\xe2\x80\x99s oldest and largest broadcasting organization, the BBC, aired a documentary containing footage meant to implicate the Assad government that anyone looking can recognize as clearly fake.
In a presentation for Media on Trial, Stuart breaks down part of the BBC documentary Saving Syria\xe2\x80\x99s Children showing clear and undeniable evidence that the footage which purports to show victims of an Assad napalm bombing has been staged and faked from top to bottom. The presentation is packed with information and the the 19-minute clip is definitely worth watching in its entirety, but for me the real clincher comes at around the four-minute mark after Stuart explains what burn victims tend to look and behave like, and he simply turns the sound off on the video footage and replays it with the question \xe2\x80\x9cjust ask yourself, is this real?\xe2\x80\x9d
It isn\xe2\x80\x99t. Plainly it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. Watch it and see for yourself; it\xe2\x80\x99s as fake as the Bana Alabed interview.
It can be hard to catch propagandists in the act in a clear and undeniable way, but these are two irrefutable examples of the top outlets in both the US and the UK airing blatantly deceitful disinformation to manufacture support for military interventionism. You can say that this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean every single thing western media reports has been deliberately and deceptively manufactured in the same way, and that\xe2\x80\x99s fair\xe2\x80\xa6 but you also can\xe2\x80\x99t say there\xe2\x80\x99s any good reason to go believing them, either. If the propaganda effort is that pervasive that it\xe2\x80\x99s airing brazen military psyops at the very top echelons of western media, you simply cannot trust anything they say about Syria. The fact that a known compulsive liar could technically be telling the truth about something at any given moment is not a legitimate reason to place your trust in him.
This one is a rabbit hole and a half, and I cannot possibly list all of the countless pieces of evidence here against the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cSyrian Civil Defense\xe2\x80\x9d aka the White Helmets, but let me try and sum it up.
Whenever you hear about a new Assad atrocity, the original source of the report is this extremely shady organization with extensive ties to both terrorist groups and western warmongers. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a new article from the Washington Post, originally from Associated Press, advancing the narrative in the headline that \xe2\x80\x9cSyrian activists\xe2\x80\x9d are reporting a chlorine gas attack. Read the article, and guess who those \xe2\x80\x9cSyrian activists\xe2\x80\x9d turn out to be? White Helmets.
You can spend days and days researching this one (and some people have devoted their lives to exactly that), but just to get at the basics of this high-level manipulation, here is a video showing footage and testimony connecting the White Helmets to violent extremist groups, and here is an article with an assortment of supporting articles detailing the organization\xe2\x80\x99s funding from the US, the UK and the EU as well as its ties to Al Qaeda. In this illuminating interview Vanessa Beeley even goes so far as to say that the White Helmets are literally just Al Qaeda members who put on white plastic headgear when they want to film propaganda to advance their agendas.
Once dismissed as a baseless conspiracy theory, it is now a known and admitted fact that the US has been arming terrorist factions in Syria to advance its regime change agendas. Utilizing extremist groups is one of the many ways the US-centralized war machine has found to get around the resistance of the American people to participating in new wars with US boots on the ground; they enlist the help of violent terrorist factions to attain their bloodthirsty goals. This is a known fact. Is there any reason to resist the notion that they\xe2\x80\x99d enlist those groups in fabricating psyops as well?
Consortiumnews recently ran an essay by Rick Sterling titled \xe2\x80\x9cWMD Claims in Syria Raise Concerns over U.S. Escalation\xe2\x80\x9d discussing the US war machine\xe2\x80\x99s extensive history of using lies, propaganda and false flags to manufacture support for military interventionism. Sterling discusses the flimsy grounds for the basis of the current anti-Assad narrative being rammed down our throats today, and reminds us simply that we have been here before, beginning his essay with the words, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the WMD story all over again.\xe2\x80\x9d
The Iraq invasion was less than fifteen years ago, and now we\xe2\x80\x99re being scaremongered about a brand new evil dictator in the same region, right next door to Iraq, who also happens to have a great love of acquiring and using WMDs. According to a new report by Reuters, citing anonymous officials as sources, there is now a risk of those weapons of mass destruction coming \xe2\x80\x9cto US shores\xe2\x80\x9d.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt will spread if we don\xe2\x80\x99t do something,\xe2\x80\x9d the official warns in the Reuters report.
Come on, people. Think harder. We\xe2\x80\x99ve done this exact dance before, and not even that long ago. They lied to you then, and they are lying to you now. If the Iraq invasion didn\xe2\x80\x99t permanently shatter your trust in this schtick, it should have. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not too late to fix that. Look at this thing critically and stop swallowing their swill.
The propagandists focus on chemical weapons because there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing else they could accuse the Assad government of doing that the US war machine doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do constantly. They can\xe2\x80\x99t accuse him of merely killing civilians with bombs, for example, because the US does that every day. If Nikki Haley tried telling the UN that there was simply too high a civilian death toll in Syria and Russia\xe2\x80\x99s bombing campaigns, the rest of the world would just say \xe2\x80\x9cOh really? America doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like civilians dying in air strikes anymore? Because we\xe2\x80\x99ve all been meaning to talk to you about that\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d
As noted by Max Abrams, \xe2\x80\x9cAssad has strong incentives not to use chemical weapons again whereas regime change supporters have every incentive to say he did.\xe2\x80\x9d The leverage he\xe2\x80\x99d be giving people like Nikki Haley to draw the wrath of the world down upon his head by committing internationally reviled war crimes would make it nonsensical for him to use an inefficient weapon like chlorine gas. It would be strategically disastrous, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t profit him any, bombs work much better, and his consistent denial of using those weapons (both inside Syria and outside) would invalidate any small advantage he might get from sending a scary message to his enemies.
Add to this the fact that some places these weapons are alleged to have been used are not only packed with his own civilians but his own soldiers as well, and you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at a completely absurd story.
If you really think about it, the only way to believe the establishment Syria narrative is to believe that Bashar al-Assad has an actual, literal sexual fetish for committing war crimes on his own people. Not only that, but you have to believe he only developed this bizarre, previously unknown sexual kink in the last few years. That\xe2\x80\x99s the only way this notion that he\xe2\x80\x99s been gassing his own civilians willy nilly can possibly make any sense at all.
Which is more likely? That, or the same establishment that lied to you about Iraq lying to you about Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s next-door neighbor?
Believing the establishment Syria narrative is indefensible. Spread the word.
