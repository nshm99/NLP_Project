Washington D.C.\xe2\x80\x99s pro football team. Aunt Jemima pancake products. Eskimo Pies. They\xe2\x80\x99re all examples of the everyday racism that bombards people of color from the supermarket to the playing field. They\xe2\x80\x99re also all iconic American products that both corporations and consumers finally agree are ready for a rebrand.
But what about the far more subtle streams of everyday racism that course through our homes, our workplaces, and the outside world? These instances may be far subtler than a mascot or an offensive term, but are no less pervasive \xe2\x80\x94 and no less deserving of cultural reckoning.
For me, this reckoning begins with traffic signals.
A few months back, before Covid-19 kept us in our homes and George Floyd made us take to the streets, I was walking with a friend, her daughter, and my twin sons. My friend is White and I\xe2\x80\x99m not \xe2\x80\x94 something I\xe2\x80\x99d never given a second thought until we reached a crosswalk. \xe2\x80\x9cRemember, honey,\xe2\x80\x9d she said to her daughter as we waited for the light to turn green, \xe2\x80\x9cwe need to wait for the little White man to appear before we can cross the street.\xe2\x80\x9d
I realize that White people like to exert control over nearly everything everyone does, I thought, but since when did this literally include trying to cross the street?
Part of my surprise here was a function of age. My boys are a few months younger than her daughter and we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet tackled the \xe2\x80\x9ccrossing the street\xe2\x80\x9d component of basic toddler training. But as a Black dad, I was struck by the language at play. How is it possible that well into the 21st century, parents all over Manhattan \xe2\x80\x94 well-meaning, #BLM-marching parents \xe2\x80\x94 are teaching their children to ask \xe2\x80\x9clittle White men\xe2\x80\x9d for permission to cross the street? And why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t this seem to bother them?
Technology and necessity propelled the shift from verbal crosswalk cues to a lunar-white Walking Person. But my heart still sinks at the specter of teaching my sons to ask a White man for permission to do \xe2\x80\x94 well, anything.
It certainly bothered me \xe2\x80\x94 so much so that I began to dig deep into my fortysomething consciousness to try and remember if I was raised asking a little White guy to let me cross the street. Were these the words my progressive White mother used to teach her little Brown children the fundamentals of pedestrian safety? Turns out, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t raised this way \xe2\x80\x94 and neither, most likely, were you.
Back when most of us were kids, stop lights and traffic signals across the U.S. typically relied on words, rather than images, to let folks know when to walk or wait or stop or cross. Go comb through photos of \xe2\x80\x9chistoric traffic signals\xe2\x80\x9d on Google Images, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see archival photos of traffic signs you might remember from childhood: Boxy black consoles that lit up with words like \xe2\x80\x9cwalk\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t walk\xe2\x80\x9d in imposing all-caps lettering.
But I wanted to know more. I wanted to know how and why this gender- and race-neutral messaging had been replaced by \xe2\x80\x9clittle White men.\xe2\x80\x9d My quest first led me to traffic light manufacturers, who then led me to pedestrian safety consultancies, who finally led me to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) \xe2\x80\x94 which is where things got interesting. Because it turns out that the \xe2\x80\x9clittle White man\xe2\x80\x9d who raised my ire isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly white. He isn\xe2\x80\x99t even really a man.
A \xe2\x80\x9chominoid\xe2\x80\x9d is how the folks at the FHWA initially described him, though later they referred to him as a gender-neutral \xe2\x80\x9cWalking Person\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94 an icon that actually dates back to the 1940s. At that time, \xe2\x80\x9cwalk\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t walk\xe2\x80\x9d typified traffic signage, but began to be phased out because words could be misunderstood by increasingly globalized populations. \xe2\x80\x9cThe use of icons instead of words on traffic signs has been a slow but steady evolution for decades because they improve universal comprehension,\xe2\x80\x9d an FHWA spokesperson says. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not a recent development.\xe2\x80\x9d
In fact, the Walking Person\xe2\x80\x99s first major move actually took place in 1971 when it became enshrined in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices \xe2\x80\x94 the FHWA bible \xe2\x80\x94 as an alternative to the words \xe2\x80\x9cWALK\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cDON\xe2\x80\x99T WALK.\xe2\x80\x9d For the next four decades or so, our little friend slowly, informally replaced its outdated predecessors until 2009; that\xe2\x80\x99s when the Walking Person finally became the FHWA standard and, as the spokesperson says, \xe2\x80\x9cthe option to use words is no longer permitted in newly installed signals.\xe2\x80\x9d One day soon, every traffic signal will contain the Walking Person, along with its counterpart: the bright red hand telling folks not to walk.
So the \xe2\x80\x9clittle man\xe2\x80\x9d is actually a little person, but that little person is still white. Right?
Close. It\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clunar white,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the FHWA: a shade of white with yellow and grey accents that mimics the color of the moon. Lunar white wasn\xe2\x80\x99t chosen because it sounds cool. According to FHWA research, the agency spokesperson says, moonlight offers \xe2\x80\x9cthe peak sensitivity for the rod cells in the human retina.\xe2\x80\x9d In other words, our vision is predisposed to favoring the clarity and intensity of moonlight.
In the end, it\xe2\x80\x99s not that the Walking Man is so super-duper white. Rather, his true competitive edge is that he\xe2\x80\x99s super-duper bright. \xe2\x80\x9cThe use of bright colors\xe2\x80\xa6 offers the greatest contrast against a dark background,\xe2\x80\x9d the FHWA spokesperson says. \xe2\x80\x9cThey do not lend themselves to confusion with other colors [and] are thought to provide the greatest level of comprehension and safety.\xe2\x80\x9d
And there you have it: The government-approved origins of the \xe2\x80\x9clittle White men\xe2\x80\x9d telling us to cross the street at corners across New York. Thanks to help from the FHWA, I am now convinced that technology and necessity, rather than some anti-Black conspiracy, propelled the shift from verbal crosswalk cues to a lunar-white Walking Person. But my heart still sinks at the specter of teaching my sons to ask a White man for permission to do \xe2\x80\x94 well, anything. Because so much of the world already insists that we do.
At a time when the totems of systemic anti-Blackness are being dismantled at a surprising pace, there comes a moment when you have to consider the endgame. And traffic lights are one of those moments. Because while this highly politicized period does demand a racial rethink, overhauling the stoplight industrial complex is probably not the best use of our resources. A White man isn\xe2\x80\x99t really telling us when to cross the street, even if we hear a friend blithely expressing it in those terms.
Nonetheless, that little White man woke me up to the ways that language imparts power and privilege even upon the most banal necessities. And so, as I begin teaching my boys survival basics like riding a bike, waiting in line, and\xe2\x80\xa6 yes\xe2\x80\xa6 crossing the street, I\xe2\x80\x99ll work hard to avoid phrases like \xe2\x80\x9clittle White man.\xe2\x80\x9d Obviously \xe2\x80\x9cbright light person\xe2\x80\x9d rolls off the tongue far less mellifluously, but a bit of extra verbal labor is worth the price of not conceding our power to even one more little White man.
