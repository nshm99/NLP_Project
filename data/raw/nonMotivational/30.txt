I was 17 years old and a junior at West Scranton High School when my boyfriend, Chris, took me to a summer music festival in Nay Aug Park.
My large Irish-Catholic family lived in Scranton, an old industrial Pennsylvania town once known for coal mining, railroads and electric streetcars. Nay Aug Park was a bustling amusement complex in the mid 1900s, complete with a carousel and a small wooden roller coaster. But during our date in 1997 the park was very different. Owners shut most of it down by then, and the city used it for events instead.
I remember walking around the festival with Chris, ordering deep-fried food like pizza fritta from the local Italian vendors, or the haluski soaked with butter from the Polish families who operated restaurants just a few miles away. Chris and I sat on the picnic bench, tapping our feet to the sounds of the live music we\xe2\x80\x99d rarely get to see, not being old enough to enter any bars.
I\xe2\x80\x99d scribble his name in my school notebooks for two years \xe2\x80\x94 this was bonafide puppy love. That night, we even held hands. It was a magical date and a happy burst of teenage hormones until he dropped me off at home for my 11 o\xe2\x80\x99clock curfew.
I was lucky enough to have the type of amazing mom who waited up for her teenager to get home. Her eyes closed, dozed off on the couch with the TV blaring, only to wake up to the sound of a slammed car door or me wrestling with house keys.
But this night\xe2\x80\x99s return home was different.
My mom was wide awake, left startled by an anonymous late night phone call she received from some member of our community who attended the same festival in the park.
This person, alarmed, called my mother to report a biracial relationship. The unknown caller said they recognized me at the park \xe2\x80\x9cholding hands with a black guy\xe2\x80\x9d and wanted to make sure she was aware.
In 1997 (and of course very long before that), this type of racist behavior was pretty common in cities across America. Sadly, twenty years later, it still is.
Born and raised in a town known for being the home of NBC\xe2\x80\x99s comedy \xe2\x80\x9cThe Office\xe2\x80\x9d, the scrappy city where former Vice President Joe Biden gets his BFD grit, or the popular final stop for presidential candidates in the swing state of Pa., the city of Scranton has made its way into popular and political culture across America.
Anyone who knows me would say I wear my blue-collar roots as a badge of honor. This very white, working-class town and my big Irish family taught me a whole lot. My now 90-year-old, World War Two veteran grandfather worked three jobs at a time, a high school janitor by morning, a railroad worker by night and a father of nine 24 hours a day.
Anyone sitting on a branch of this family tree learned the importance of family, faith and friendships, what it means to be loyal, what it means to have work ethic, and how to fight for the little guy.
But it\xe2\x80\x99s also in this town, like many white working-class cities across the U.S., where racists are born. As former President Barack Obama reminded us in the most liked tweet in history, Nelson Mandela was right in noting that no child is actually born hating another person, but not much time is wasted in these cities before many young people are taught to hate.
My siblings and I are among the lucky ones, each of us instilled with open hearts and minds and a curiosity and appreciation for all this diverse world has to offer, but we have met and interacted with a lot of racists in our lifetimes.
These racists are school educators, like the guy standing outside of the bar in 2016 who yelled \xe2\x80\x9cNo niggers welcome!\xe2\x80\x9d at my black friend visiting Scranton with me from Washington D.C.
These racists are local business owners, like the ones who didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to serve an interracial couple in one of the city\xe2\x80\x99s local establishments or the guy in charge of the local bar for war veterans who still, in 2017, won\xe2\x80\x99t let anyone become a member unless they\xe2\x80\x99re white, insisting applicants apply in person and telling minorities who show up that \xe2\x80\x9cmembership is full.\xe2\x80\x9d
These racists are our Facebook \xe2\x80\x9cfriends,\xe2\x80\x9d like the popular middle school classmate who I haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked to since 7th grade, but he and his friends engaged in a recent social media thread that biracial dating is \xe2\x80\x9cdisgusting,\xe2\x80\x9d that I should be \xe2\x80\x9cashamed,\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cour race is screwed\xe2\x80\x9d and they have guns at the ready to \xe2\x80\x9cbeat them [black people] to the dirt.\xe2\x80\x9d Unfriend.
And sadly, in some cases, these racists share our DNA, like a handful of members of my mostly open-minded and accepting family who tell jokes with the N-word and tell their daughters never to bring a black man home.
I\xe2\x80\x99ve never written about or talked about any of these experiences in a public way given how much pain and embarrassment they bring, but this past weekend\xe2\x80\x99s events in Charlottesville, Va. are forcing me to think differently about my role as a white woman in our racially divided country.
The ignorant white supremacists, neo-Nazi marchers from this weekend are people we know. They are around us daily, they are related to us, and they are embedded in the cultural, institutional, and political infrastructure of this country in more ways than we care to admit. But we don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it. Some of us hope it will just magically go away. Some of us don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s our problem to fix. Some of us are perfectly fine with it continuing.
After this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s events, former Washington Post colleague and founder of Define American, Jose Antonio Vargas tweeted:
\xe2\x80\x9cDear Well-Meaning White People Who Want Nothing To Do With Alt-Right: We, people of color, cannot carry this burden. You must engage.\xe2\x80\x9d
He\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely right.
Like most of the white people whose hearts and minds are on the right side of history, I\xe2\x80\x99m sickened by what happened in Charlottesville. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same feeling I had when nine black church-goers were shot dead by a white supremacist in South Carolina, and the same feeling I had when the not guilty verdicts came down after the deaths of Trayvon Martin, Philando Castile, and Freddie Gray.
I spent the hours following these events \xe2\x80\x9cengaging,\xe2\x80\x9d tweeting quotes from the most prominent civil rights activists like Martin Luther King Jr., James Baldwin or my favorite poet Maya Angelou. My body filled up with so much rage that I felt like my retweets on a social media platform of like-minded followers would make a difference. But the right people were not listening. The right people were not reading my Twitter feed. What I hope we can do now is step away from our comfortable bubbles and get uncomfortable.
Let\xe2\x80\x99s really engage.
Let\xe2\x80\x99s speak up. Let\xe2\x80\x99s turn to our closed-minded family members who make us furious and ask them why. Let\xe2\x80\x99s turn to our open-minded friends and family who text you privately \xe2\x80\x9ccan I post this?\xe2\x80\x9d and ask them why not.
Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about race at the dinner table, in the office, on our social media feeds, at our evenings out with friends, or anywhere we might normally stay silent on this tough topic. We might feel like we are saying the wrong words, don\xe2\x80\x99t have words, or think that we will end up doing more harm than good. Let\xe2\x80\x99s try.
Let\xe2\x80\x99s stop patronizing businesses that we know are led by people with racists beliefs. That will surely put the issue at their front doorstep.
Let\xe2\x80\x99s not just stop laughing at racist jokes, but asking the person why it was told in the first place.
Let\xe2\x80\x99s look around, study the diversity of our workplaces and recognize our role in making it better. It\xe2\x80\x99s not on the handful of minority employees to create and execute a diversity plan. It\xe2\x80\x99s on the white people at every level across the company to take responsibility for creating a workplace of diverse people and views and for recognizing what a better company you will be for it.
Let\xe2\x80\x99s get proximate. I spent this week polling a number of family members, asking some how they ended up so open-minded growing up in our environment and asking others if they think it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to change. Those exchanges gave me more hope this past week than anything I\xe2\x80\x99ve read online.
Some attributed their appreciation for diversity to their proximity to non-white members of the family or friends, others pointed to \xe2\x80\x9chonest\xe2\x80\x9d history books, church teachings, travel to other cities, joining diverse athletic teams and school clubs, and one even said it was the women of the family who truly helped reshape their views more than others.
And when I posed the question to other members of the family who I suspected weren\xe2\x80\x99t following this week\xe2\x80\x99s events and maybe didn\xe2\x80\x99t care, they proved me wrong. One challenged my assumption and even pointed out how different things are since I left Scranton twenty years ago. He said while we may have been exposed to a lot of racism growing up, our generation is maturing and forming new opinions and beliefs of our own. He also smartly noted that every family and individual is going to have to address racism differently. It just starts by recognizing it\xe2\x80\x99s there and saying something out loud.
Let\xe2\x80\x99s begin turning the page in our country\xe2\x80\x99s history of racism and oppression, knowing that page will only turn if we, white people, acknowledge our role in turning it.
\xe2\x80\x9cIn the end we will remember not the words of our enemy, but the silence of our friends.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Martin Luther King, Jr.
