In a move as pathetic as it is dangerous, Donald Trump recently announced the \xe2\x80\x9cOffice of the Former President.\xe2\x80\x9d Trump so describes the newly-minted \xe2\x80\x9coffice\xe2\x80\x9d and its responsibilities:
The office will be responsible for managing President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s correspondence, public statements, appearances and official activities to advance the interests of the United States and to carry on the agenda of the Trump administration through advocacy, organizing and public activism.
It won\xe2\x80\x99t matter to his followers that a former president has no official activities, no agenda to carry and no administration to manage, because, once again, Trump is abusing traditions and norms to further his interests.
Officially, former presidents should be addressed as \xe2\x80\x9cThe Honourable.\xe2\x80\x9d In recent years, it has become a tradition to refer to them as \xe2\x80\x9cMr President\xe2\x80\x9d or (one day soon) \xe2\x80\x9cMs President\xe2\x80\x9d as a matter of courtesy and respect for the office and their service to the nation.
Trump knows how important words are, as inarticulate as he may seem. If he is good at something, it\xe2\x80\x99s marketing and self-promotion. Calling himself \xe2\x80\x9cPresident Trump\xe2\x80\x9d goes beyond tradition: it reinforces the idea that he is still the President. It is another way for him not to concede and to further his Big Lie that the Democrats stole the election from him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t concede when there\xe2\x80\x99s theft involved,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the crowd on January 6. This move is a continuation on the same line.
Not surprisingly at all, the Trump propaganda network (OANN and Newsmax) only uses \xe2\x80\x9cPresident Trump\xe2\x80\x9d, but they have shifted to using \xe2\x80\x9cObama\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cBarack Obama\xe2\x80\x9d only, as shown in the screenshots below. This choice of words is a deliberate move to reinforce the idea that the \xe2\x80\x9coffice of the former president\xe2\x80\x9d has an official capacity and that this capacity only belongs to \xe2\x80\x9cPresident Trump.\xe2\x80\x9d
The press release also states that as the former president, Mr Trump will handle official activities to advance the United States' interests and carry on the agenda of the Trump administration. Once again, the words are purposefully chosen to imbue this sham office with dignity and powers it does not have. It gives the impression to the ignorant that Mr Trump will continue representing the country, that he still has leeway to affect the legislative agenda.
This wording also doubles as a promise. Trump is signalling to his base that he will not abandon them, that he will \xe2\x80\x9ccontinue the fight.\xe2\x80\x9d Looking back at his four years in office, it is evident that Trump never had a plan beyond making himself rich, dividing the country, inciting a coup, and hurting minorities. Saying he will \xe2\x80\x9ccarry on\xe2\x80\x9d is a symbolic way to reassure all the racists and bigots of the land that white supremacy will endure with him.
Of course, private citizens are barred from exercising any official activities that purport to represent the United States of America officially. This interdiction comes from the Logan Act of 1799. Only two people have ever been indicted under the Act, both in the 19th century; none was ever convicted. Legal scholars question the act's constitutionality; it could soon be tested in court by none other than Trump himself, should he decide to engage in discussions with, say, Mr Putin.
We will not explore the legal risks to which Mr Trump exposes himself with his \xe2\x80\x9coffice,\xe2\x80\x9d it is clear that his latest move presents a clear and imminent danger to the country.
By setting himself up as a legitimate counter-power to the White House, Trump is effectively creating as a shadow administration. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if Trump starts appointing a shadow cabinet and security council in the days to come. Once again, the Deep State will have been nothing more than a projection.
Such a move, were it to happen, would put the U.S. on a terrible path, that of secession and potential Civil War. If the Biden\xe2\x80\x99s administration legitimacy is not only questioned rhetorically but also threatened physically by a competing cabinet and an anti-president, who\xe2\x80\x99s to say what will happen.
What will Cruz, Hawley, Cawthorn, Taylor-Greene, Boebert, Jordan, Tuberville, and other sedition caucus\xe2\x80\x99s members do? Will they join Trump and form a shadow parliament?
House Minority Leader McCarthy has already made the Mar-a-Lago pilgrimage. The message here is clear: Congress Republicans have sought Trump\xe2\x80\x99s seal of approval, increasing the perceived legitimacy of his \xe2\x80\x9coffice.\xe2\x80\x9d Republican senators have already indicated they will not vote to convict Trump. Everything is falling into place.
Make no mistake. This joke will not end up funny at all if the Department of Justice does nothing to bar Trump from claiming powers he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have and titles he is not allowed to bear. It already happened once in American history. A rich lunatic declared himself emperor of America and protector of Mexico under the name \xe2\x80\x9cEmperor Norton.\xe2\x80\x9d It made for good laughs.
The Emperor has found a new groove, though. This time, he comes imbued with the legitimacy of a term in office and propped up by the Big Lie that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose reelection: it was merely stolen from him.
Emperor Donald isn\xe2\x80\x99t a laughing stock. He is the first step towards secession and Civil War, and he must be stopped.
