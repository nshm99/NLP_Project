America, I got to tell ya \xe2\x80\x94 we suck at laying pipe.
Our pipeline craftmanship is garbage. These things break all the time. You know how I know? I fucking googled it.
There have been 27 pipeline accidents in 2016 so far. There were 42 in 2015.
Wherever a pipeline gets installed, our government is letting oil companies play roulette with American lives. Every time one of these things busts open, it risks spilling gas, oil and jet fuel into our own fucking water supply.
And yesterday some guy accidentally hit one with a fucking trackhoe and caused an explosion so massive it put 6 people in the hospital.
America, I know you seem to think terrorism is a problem but have you considered how much terror these pipelines are running beneath our feet?
And for what? At least terrorists think they have a cause. What possible rationale is there for us to let oil companies play pipeline roulette with the Mississippi tributary system? America, we allow our own wells to be poisoned so a handful of assholes can get rich enough to go suck salmon roe off some kid\xe2\x80\x99s ass in Bangkok.
Oil companies executives are just useful idiots who get paid absurdly well to run murder through the ground. Where we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the Dakota Access Pipeline in particular, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about Energy Transfer. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll consider this an invitation to go troll around its garbage site, you\xe2\x80\x99ll see it\xe2\x80\x99s basically a shell corporation spongy for investment. It exists to make rich people richer. Why, yes, of course Trump\xe2\x80\x99s an investor.
Who else, though?

AMY GOODMAN: How are the banks involved?
HUGH MACMILLAN: Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 they are banking on this company and banking on being able to drill and frack for the oil to send through the pipeline over the coming decades. So they\xe2\x80\x99re providing the capital for the construction of this pipeline. \xe2\x80\xa6 Well, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a list of the 17 banks that are specifically providing financing for this project\xe2\x80\xa6 Citibank is the bank that\xe2\x80\x99s been running the books on the project, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the bank that beat the bushes and got other banks to join in. So, we have Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas, SunTrust, Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Mizuho Bank, TD Securities, ABN AMRO Capital, DNB First Bank \xe2\x80\x94 and that\xe2\x80\x99s actually a bank based in Philly; it\xe2\x80\x99s not the DNB Bank based in Norway, which is actually provided several hundred million to the Energy Transfer family separately \xe2\x80\x94 and ICBC London, SMBC Nikko Securities and Soci\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 G\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9rale.
Right, so we know investment banks know running murder through the ground is going to continue to generate return on investment for decades to come. In fact, they\xe2\x80\x99re literally \xe2\x80\x94 wait for it \xe2\x80\x94 banking on it.
So to guarantee the murdersauce never stops flowing, oil companies and their executives pay off other useful idiots like North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple in huge campaign contributions. And not missing his chance to get his dick in on this circlejerk, Governor Jack Dalrymple buys stock in the oil companies.
Why give a fuck when you get paid to not give a fuck? That\xe2\x80\x99s how Dalrymple rolls.
That\xe2\x80\x99s how America rolls.
Heads up, though, because these things are shit and break all the time.
Only a matter of time.
Tick tock.
