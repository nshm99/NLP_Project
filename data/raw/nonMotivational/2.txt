Sunday night, like so many other women, I created a #MeToo post. Instead of telling a story of sexual harassment, I showed it via two photos from my college thesis project, \xe2\x80\x9cShooting Back\xe2\x80\x9d (1986\xe2\x80\x9388), with a quick tossed-off line: \xe2\x80\x9c#MeToo, too many times to count. With photographic evidence, even.\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x9cShooting Back\xe2\x80\x9d began as an exercise in self-therapy, after a stranger broke into my dorm room and then broke me. (I\xe2\x80\x99d also been mugged at gunpoint twice, once with my friend John, another time alone, as well as kicked unconscious on a busy street while walking home at 9 PM from the library, as well as sexually assaulted by a group of drunk men while walking home from a video store. But I digress.) The photos in \xe2\x80\x9cShooting Back\xe2\x80\x9d were of men who\xe2\x80\x99d harassed me on the street. After they\xe2\x80\x99d say, \xe2\x80\x9cHey, baby, wanna get it on?\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99d say, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you, but I would like to shoot your photo.\xe2\x80\x9d I had a Nikkormat with a single fixed 28-millimeter lens back then, so that\xe2\x80\x99s what I used. Meaning, to do this project, I had to get up in their faces, super close, and use my camera as a weapon. It was a small shift in the power dynamic, but it was my own form of grace and reclamation, turning hunter into prey.
That college thesis \xe2\x80\x94 that transformation of my hidden pain into visible art \xe2\x80\x94 launched my career. It was published in Boston Magazine, PHOTO, and Photomagazine. It was nominated for a W. Eugene Smith Award. It landed me a spot as one of only two females exhibited at the first Visa Pour L\xe2\x80\x99Image photojournalism festival in Perpignan, France. It got my foot in the door at the photo agencies and publications that sent me to Israel, then Afghanistan and beyond.
The two photos I posted on Sunday night were unusual for the series, as they were acts of sexual harassment caught in medias res. One was of men in wolf masks who\xe2\x80\x99d chased me down a street in downtown Boston. And then there was the man in Boston\xe2\x80\x99s Combat Zone who\xe2\x80\x99d said, \xe2\x80\x9cHey, baby, wanna get it on,\xe2\x80\x9d and I\xe2\x80\x99d said, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, thank you, but I would like to shoot your photo,\xe2\x80\x9d but before I could approach him with my 28-millimeter lens, he flashed me. So I quickly shot the photo from five feet away and ran.
An hour after posting these two photos on Facebook, I was informed that I\xe2\x80\x99d been suspended from the social media site for 24-hours for posting \xe2\x80\x9ccontent that threatens or promotes sexual violence or exploitation.\xe2\x80\x9d The admonition went further: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere appropriate,\xe2\x80\x9d it said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe refer this content to law enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d I was hurt, horrified, and, frankly, re-traumatized. The image of that flasher has nothing to do with \xe2\x80\x9cpromoting sexual violence or exploitation\xe2\x80\x9d and everything to do with unmasking it, because how often does one get documentary proof of sexual predation? Almost never. And that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the most insidious part of sexual harassment: its utter invisibility.
It\xe2\x80\x99s like all of us women are Big Birds, and there\xe2\x80\x99s this giant mastodon of sexual predation only we can see. But finally, here was proof. Snuffleupagus exists! And here\xe2\x80\x99s a photo of a flasher to prove it.
It\xe2\x80\x99s been 30 years since I shot \xe2\x80\x9cShooting Back,\xe2\x80\x9d and we\xe2\x80\x99re finally talking about male predatory behavior toward women in a way that feels different, more urgent, thanks to Harvey Weinstein\xe2\x80\x99s outrageous use of it. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped for me, nor for any of us. I lost a column and a bit of decent extra income recently, after not answering my editor\xe2\x80\x99s email, in which he wrote, in response to my email asking what time the staff pizza party began, \xe2\x80\x9c1 PM. How come you\xe2\x80\x99ve never asked me out?\xe2\x80\x9d But until Alyssa Milano suggested Tarana Burke\xe2\x80\x99s decade-old #MeToo hashtag, until all of our social media feeds were flooded with stories of inappropriate male behavior and predation, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how many men truly understood our silent pain: the aggressions themselves, of course, but also the cone of silence, the lack of evidence, the fear of being labeled a woman who cries wolf. Only in this case, I had the wolves to prove it! I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just crying wolf. I was showing them to you.
And then, as usual in this endless game of wolf and prey, I was summarily punished for exposing them.
***UPDATE 10/19/17, 6:45 AM: In the comments below, a man named Brad Cook from Facebook saw this story and took swift action to restore the original content. Thank you, Brad! I appreciate it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve made suggestions as to how this might be avoided in the future in my response to your comment.
