The Hollywood mogul\xe2\x80\x99s ostensible mea culpa is a perfectly written example of things not to do when you are apologizing.
For decades, Harvey Weinstein has served as the real-life inspiration for every tyrannical, foul-mouthed, hot-headed fictional movie studio executive. For pretty much just as long, according to a bombshell report from the New York Times, Weinstein has been serial sexually harassing aspiring young actresses who come into his orbit.
The Times offers a lengthy list of women, some of them now famous, who were allegedly subjected to Weinstein\xe2\x80\x99s lewd overtures, including Ashley Judd, who says Weinstein requested she watch him shower and Rose McGowan, whom Weinstein gave a settlement in 1997 following \xe2\x80\x9can episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival.\xe2\x80\x9d
There were at least eight more hush money pay outs, per the Times, to recipients including \xe2\x80\x9ca young assistant in New York in 1990, an actress in 1997, an assistant in London in 1998, an Italian model in 2015 and [former Weinstein Company employee Lauren] O\xe2\x80\x99Connor shortly after.\xe2\x80\x9d With a traceable track record like that, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost impossible to believe that there aren\xe2\x80\x99t other women who chose to keep quiet rather than take on one of the most powerful men in Hollywood.
In response to the Times report, Weinstein released a statement that is an ostensible mea culpa but reads more like a perfectly written example of things not to do when you are apologizing. Let\xe2\x80\x99s run through some of the highlights, shall we?
\xe2\x80\x9cI came of age in the \xe2\x80\x9960s and \xe2\x80\x9970s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different. That was the culture then.\xe2\x80\x9d
I came of age at a time when the workplace was where men went to compare dick size with other men, and then we\xe2\x80\x99d have our secretaries \xe2\x80\x94 or \xe2\x80\x9cskirts,\xe2\x80\x9d as we called them \xe2\x80\x94 judge who won. Was that bad? Me confused by all these new rules.

\xe2\x80\x9cI have since learned it\xe2\x80\x99s not an excuse, in the office \xe2\x80\x94 or out of it. To anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d
I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned it\xe2\x80\x99s not an excuse, and yet I still offered it as an excuse, because I\xe2\x80\x99ll level with you here: I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned nothing.
\xe2\x80\x9cI realized some time ago I that needed to be a better person, and my interactions with the people I work with have changed. I appreciate the way I\xe2\x80\x99ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it. Though I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go. That is my commitment. My journey now will be to learn about myself and conquer my demons.\xe2\x80\x9d
Well, this seems like progress, right?
Just wait.
\xe2\x80\x9cOver the last year, I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked [celebrity lawyer] Lisa Bloom to tutor me, and she\xe2\x80\x99s put together a team of people. I\xe2\x80\x99ve brought on therapists, and I plan to take a leave of absence from my company and to deal with this issue head on.\xe2\x80\x9d
Lisa Bloom told the Times that Weinstein is \xe2\x80\x9can old dinosaur learning new ways\xe2\x80\x9d and that she \xe2\x80\x9cexplained to him that due to the power difference between a major studio head like him and most others in the industry, whatever his motives, some of his words and behaviors can be perceived as inappropriate, even intimidating.\xe2\x80\x9d
What\xe2\x80\x99s weird about this is that I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure Weinstein already understands the power differential at play between him and \xe2\x80\x9cmost others in the industry,\xe2\x80\x9d particularly hopeful actors. One woman who temped for Weinstein said he told her that \xe2\x80\x9cif she accepted his sexual advances, he would boost her career.\xe2\x80\x9d O\xe2\x80\x99Connor said that Weinstein\xe2\x80\x99s targets were almost invariably \xe2\x80\x9cvulnerable women who hope he will get them work.\xe2\x80\x9d Weinstein \xe2\x80\x94 a six-time Oscar winner and titan in the film industry \xe2\x80\x94 understood with crystal clarity his own status vs. those he allegedly dangled careers in front of for varying sexual favors. Alleged sexual harassers and abusers such as Bill O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly, Bill Cosby and Roger Ailes, among many others, use their power against those who have none. That\xe2\x80\x99s how this whole awful thing works.
I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure Weinstein already understands the power differential at play between him and \xe2\x80\x98most others in the industry.\xe2\x80\x99
Also, for the record, the fact that Weinstein reportedly used his fortune to pay off women and keep all those charges quiet suggests he\xe2\x80\x99s well aware that his behaviors are \xe2\x80\x9cinappropriate, even intimidating.\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x9cI so respect all women, and regret what happened.\xe2\x80\x9d
God. That \xe2\x80\x9cso\xe2\x80\x9d is really not helping here. Someone should\xe2\x80\x99ve read this thing out loud before they sent it out.
\xe2\x80\x9cJay Z wrote in 4:44 \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not the man I thought I was, and I better be that man for my children.\xe2\x80\x99 The same is true for me.\xe2\x80\x9d
Honestly, Harvey Weinstein borrowing a Jay-Z lyric about his marital infidelity to Beyonc\xc3\xa9 to describe his contrition about harassing who knows how many women over the last 30 years is just too much to get into right now. (Who is that arbitrary insertion even for? The \xe2\x80\x9ckidz\xe2\x80\x9d? Maybe in his next sorry-not-sorry letter he\xe2\x80\x99ll quote Lil Yachty or something.) It is worth noting that the line isn\xe2\x80\x99t an actual Jay-Z quote, just to give you a sense of the real time and heartfelt labor that went into this thing.
\xe2\x80\x9cI want a second chance in the community, but I know I\xe2\x80\x99ve got work to do to earn it.\xe2\x80\x9d
What community? You mean Hollywood? Mel Gibson is on the up-and-up these days and the Golden Globes gave Woody Allen a Lifetime Achievement Award just three years ago. Fox News fired Bill O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly six months ago and then welcomed him back last month like an esteemed honoree at a medal ceremony. As I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you already know, \xe2\x80\x9cthe community\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d is just awaiting a sign from the echo chamber on when it\xe2\x80\x99s okay to be cool with you again.

\xe2\x80\x9cI have goals that are now priorities. Trust me, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t an overnight process. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to do this for 10 years, and this is a wake-up call.\xe2\x80\x9d
Wait, so according to Harvey Weinstein, he\xe2\x80\x99s been trying to \xe2\x80\x9cdo this\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 meaning \xe2\x80\x9cbe better\xe2\x80\x9d we presume \xe2\x80\x94 for \xe2\x80\x9c10 years\xe2\x80\x9d? I would genuinely love to hear what kind of all-powerful pervy forces have been forcing Harvey Weinstein \xe2\x80\x94 the man whom 90 percent of Hollywood is legit afraid to piss off \xe2\x80\x94 to keep sexually harassing women for the last decade.
Here\xe2\x80\x99s where it really gets good by which I mean off the g.d. rails.
\xe2\x80\x9cI am going to need a place to channel that anger, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve decided that I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give the NRA my full attention. I hope Wayne LaPierre will enjoy his retirement party. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do it at the same place I had my Bar Mitzvah. I\xe2\x80\x99m making a movie about our President, perhaps we can make it a joint retirement party.\xe2\x80\x9d
On the heels of the latest mass shooting, many of us welcome any takedown of the NRA. And considering his historic unpopularity, it\xe2\x80\x99s always nice to hear mention of Trump no longer having access to the nuclear codes. But the whole tone of this section verges on the bizarre, that is until you remember you are in the midst of a pissing match, midstream. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to throw you a party in the same place where I became a man, which you should consider a direct threat to your own manhood through some convoluted illogical thought stream I won\xe2\x80\x99t explain.\xe2\x80\x9d Or something.
You are in the midst of a pissing match.
Anyway, if there are three people who seem perfect for some sort of man-off, it\xe2\x80\x99s Weinstein, Trump and the head of the NRA. So there\xe2\x80\x99s that.
\xe2\x80\x9cOne year ago, I began organizing a $5 million foundation to give scholarships to women directors at USC. While this might seem coincidental, it has been in the works for a year. It will be named after my mom, and I won\xe2\x80\x99t disappoint her.\xe2\x80\x9d
I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing. Let\xe2\x80\x99s just be sure every scholarship includes a clause that states, \xe2\x80\x9cYou are in no way now, nor in the future, beholden to Harvey Weinstein.\xe2\x80\x9d Just be safe.
