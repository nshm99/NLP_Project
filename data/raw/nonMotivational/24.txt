You\xe2\x80\x99re not supposed to talk about how frustrating it is to watch children screw things up.
You\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be patient when it takes them 17 minutes to tie their shoelaces. You\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to applaud their migraine-inducing attempts to play the violin. You\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to give your undivided attention as they tell stories that somehow lack a beginning, a middle, and an end.
But worst of all is when a child wants to \xe2\x80\x9chelp\xe2\x80\x9d you with something. You know that accepting their help will quadruple the time, energy, and resources required to get anything done. You realise that it\xe2\x80\x99d be far simpler to do the job yourself. You\xe2\x80\x99re aware that they\xe2\x80\x99ll get bored halfway through and give up. But what are you supposed to tell them? They\xe2\x80\x99re so enthusiastic, so earnest, so eager to contribute. So you take a deep breath, grit your teeth into a smile, and watch them make a mess.
If you\xe2\x80\x99ve been watching the trajectory of anti-racism over the past few years, you can probably relate. It\xe2\x80\x99s become an exercise in patiently explaining things that should be painfully obvious. It\xe2\x80\x99s an endless parade of clickbait headlines and performative outrage. It\xe2\x80\x99s dominated by people who seem as if they want to help but are hopelessly confused about how to do so.
For example, Los Angeles private institution Brentwood School recently announced plans to segregate parent-teacher meetings by race as part of its (and I\xe2\x80\x99m not kidding here) \xe2\x80\x9cInclusive Excellence Racial Equity\xe2\x80\x9d initiative. White parents will meet with White teachers, Black parents will meet with Black teachers, Latinx parents with Latinx teachers. I presume that interracial families will need to separate in the name of progress.
Watching these \xe2\x80\x9callies\xe2\x80\x9d blunder their way around the anti-racism landscape feels like watching a toddler trying to perform open-heart surgery. The stakes are too high. The mistakes are too costly.
If a child had an idea this asinine, it would be easier to cope. You could explain in clear, age-appropriate language why racial segregation is not the best path to \xe2\x80\x9cinclusive excellence.\xe2\x80\x9d You could point out that while some parents may have issues directly related to their race, preventing other parents and teachers from hearing them is likely to make those problems worse. You could remind them in your gentlest, most tender-hearted voice that classifying people by race promotes racism, rather than \xe2\x80\x94 what was it again? Oh yes, INCLUSIVE EXCELLENCE AND RACIAL EQUITY!
A few hours north in the Bay Area, there\xe2\x80\x99s Meyerholz Elementary School, where eight-year-old children learn to rank themselves according to the power and privilege of their race, gender, and sexuality. It\xe2\x80\x99s how you might reimagine Jane Elliott\xe2\x80\x99s famous \xe2\x80\x9cbrown eyes, blue eyes\xe2\x80\x9d experiment if you utterly failed to understand it.
These children aren\xe2\x80\x99t learning to look beyond their superficial differences. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t learning the importance of treating others with compassion. They\xe2\x80\x99re being taught, at eight years old, that the most fundamental aspects of who they are will forever mark them as \xe2\x80\x9coppressor\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9coppressed.\xe2\x80\x9d They\xe2\x80\x99re learning to think of each other as a collection of labels instead of complex human beings. They\xe2\x80\x99ll likely carry the hangover of this \xe2\x80\x9ceducation\xe2\x80\x9d for the rest of their lives.
Then we have the people who treat racism as if it\xe2\x80\x99s a treasure hunt. They scurry around in search of increasingly abstract, petty, blink-and-you\xe2\x80\x99ll-miss-it forms of racism to submit for our approval. Gardening, rocks, Mozart, knitting, the countryside, cycling, floristry, fast food (but also veganism), and more have been \xe2\x80\x9ccalled out\xe2\x80\x9d in the name of anti-racism. Even worse, respected news organisations uncritically publish this nonsense so that everybody can see how \xe2\x80\x9cwoke\xe2\x80\x9d they are.
If I were a more cynical person, I might suspect that these people aren\xe2\x80\x99t trying to fight racism at all. I might ask whether headlines like \xe2\x80\x9cCan Dogs Be Racist?\xe2\x80\x9d are designed to do anything more than attract clicks and advertising dollars. I might even suggest that the people who write this garbage are motivated by nothing more than greed and the desire to collect virtue-signaling brownie points on Twitter.
And while I\xe2\x80\x99d like to give them the pat on the head they\xe2\x80\x99re so desperately seeking, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to ignore the fact that every column inch wasted on \xe2\x80\x9carticles\xe2\x80\x9d about whether the Smurfs were racist could have been used to write about real issues. Some issues feel a little more pressing: That Black male offenders still receive prison sentences which are, on average, 20% longer than White offenders for the same crime; that Black families are only half as likely to own their homes as White families; or that there are still serious disparities in treatment and outcomes for students of colour.
Last, but by no means least infuriating, are the saviors: People who are so excited to show off what they learned during their mandatory diversity training that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t noticed (or simply don\xe2\x80\x99t care) how racist they\xe2\x80\x99re being.
These are the people who target Black police officers at protests so that they can scream in their faces about Black rights. Or they turn up at Black Lives Matter rallies with whip marks painted on their bodies without the tiniest glimmer of self-awareness. They\xe2\x80\x99re the same people who explain that people of colour need special treatment if we turn up late for appointments because it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cculturally insensitive\xe2\x80\x9d to expect us to demonstrate time management skills. They have taken terms like \xe2\x80\x9cWhite supremacy\xe2\x80\x9d and diluted their meaning to the point that we\xe2\x80\x99re losing the ability to differentiate between benign ignorance and true hatred.
Watching these \xe2\x80\x9callies\xe2\x80\x9d blunder their way around the anti-racism landscape feels like watching a toddler trying to perform open-heart surgery. The stakes are too high. The mistakes are too costly. The constant distractions make it too difficult to focus on the issues that matter. While I want to believe that their hearts (if not their brains) are in the right place, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to be blunt.
So, on behalf of everybody who has a stake in this fight, this \xe2\x80\x9chelp\xe2\x80\x9d is not helping. You\xe2\x80\x99re pushing regressive policies and calling them progress. You\xe2\x80\x99re squandering opportunities to say something meaningful with garbage clickbait. You\xe2\x80\x99re framing the fight for equality as a battle between \xe2\x80\x9cWhiteness\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cBlackness\xe2\x80\x9d when, if you were a little wiser, you\xe2\x80\x99d know that it\xe2\x80\x99s always required people of all colours.
Look, I promise, as soon as we\xe2\x80\x99ve finished making the world a safer and fairer place for people of colour, we\xe2\x80\x99ll move straight onto pressing issues like why so many robots are White. We\xe2\x80\x99ll conduct a thorough investigation into the racist history of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. We\xe2\x80\x99ll answer all of your questions about why racial segregation is not a marker of progress. But until then, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you go and play with your toys or something?
The grown-ups have important work to do.
