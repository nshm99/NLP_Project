One evening I watched Ron Jeremy scavenge the leftover food a few of us at the table didn\xe2\x80\x99t eat. It was a surreal experience sitting across from one of the largest names in the porn industry and, on a personal level, someone whose videos I\xe2\x80\x99d seen.
\xe2\x80\x9cHe does this,\xe2\x80\x9d my friend Craig told me.\xe2\x80\x9cDoes what?\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cNever orders anything. He just scavenges everyone else\xe2\x80\x99s leftovers once they\xe2\x80\x99re done eating.\xe2\x80\x9d
I continued to observe the man nicknamed \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hedgehog\xe2\x80\x9d pluck fries from his niece\xe2\x80\x99s plate. Then he pulled out an old Motorola flip phone from the pajama pants he wore to the restaurant.
Craig motioned to Ron with a subtle nod of his head, \xe2\x80\x9cWatch this.\xe2\x80\x9d
Ron produced a monocle \xe2\x80\x94 or a mini telescope, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure \xe2\x80\x94 from his jacket to read his text messages.
\xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t buy a new phone. God knows he has the money. I keep telling him it\xe2\x80\x99ll be easier to see messages on a smartphone, but\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x9cBut I gotta keep up those good Jewish habits!\xe2\x80\x9d Ron chimed in.
Earlier in the evening, Craig and Ron debated the subject of pornography in front of a large audience in Austin, Texas. I met Craig several years earlier after I took steps to crush the control pornography had over my life. Early in the dot com boom Craig founded an organization named XXXchurch with goal of helping Christians combat their pornography consumption or addiction. As a former youth pastor, many young males in his church shared about their widespread porn usage wreaking hell in their personal lives. At first, the Christian community damn near crucified (and vilified) him, but once the widespread usage hit pastors and led to scandal, they played a different tune. No good deed goes unpunished in Christendom, right?
In real life, Craig and Ron are friends. Craig\xe2\x80\x99s kids call him \xe2\x80\x9cUncle Ron\xe2\x80\x9d but have no idea what he does. As their friendship formed because of working in the porn industry on separate sides, both took their debate on the road to universities and churches.
In all fairness, I felt Ron won the debate that night. He was charming, articulate, and made several candid points. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the porn industry\xe2\x80\x99s fault people got hooked or did deviant things. \xe2\x80\x9cIn fact,\xe2\x80\x9d Ron grinned as he held up a gold embossed piece of paper, \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s a certificate of appreciation from the FBI to our industry. We\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with law enforcement to report minors who\xe2\x80\x99ve ended up in porn and exploited the managers who\xe2\x80\x99ve used minors.\xe2\x80\x9d
Craig could have gone harder on him, but stuck more to a charismatic presence on the stage focusing on the unrealistic expectations porn promises. Maybe he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have all the stats that night, I never asked. Hell, some of the research was brand new at the time.
But it\xe2\x80\x99s not anymore, and what it\xe2\x80\x99s doing to men and women across the globe has a direct impact on why #metoo happened and why we keep seeing repeat stories of the increase in sexual assault and rape culture.
It\xe2\x80\x99s no longer the dirty little secret, but the monster rampaging in our society.
After the Harvey Weinstein scandal and recent events exposing widespread sexual assault, the public outcry has become overwhelming. I read through numerous articles (and even wrote my own) on the topic, but one thing I found disturbing was the amount of men and women who continued to advocate from porn (whether on Medium or in other media outlets). \xe2\x80\x9cJerk it to responsible porn\xe2\x80\x9d one author said as a way to combat sexual assault and support women. \xe2\x80\x9cAmateur, non-binary, or one that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t promote violence.\xe2\x80\x9d It was like listening to someone tell me there\xe2\x80\x99s such a thing as fair, trade organic porn. It\xe2\x80\x99s been responsibly filmed and no women were degraded in the filming of these sex scenes. Yeah, right.
The notion alone is absurd, because how it\xe2\x80\x99s filmed, amateur or not, consenting or not, romantic or not, has nothing to do with what porn usage does neurologically and emotionally.
In 2011, leading psychologist Philip Zimbardo released a TEDTalk and subsequent book titled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Demise of Guys.\xe2\x80\x9d One finding in his talk focused on men preferring porn to women and no longer \xe2\x80\x9cknowing the difference between making love and doing porn.\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed to video games and porn being a new addiction he dubbed \xe2\x80\x9carousal addiction.\xe2\x80\x9d Whereas drugs and alcohol you want more of the same, with porn your taste constantly evolves.
Additional research supports what Zimbardo found and explains the process like a twisted version of Pavlov\xe2\x80\x99s Dog. People think they\xe2\x80\x99re being entertained, but their brains are busy building connections between the arousal they feel and what\xe2\x80\x99s happening on screen. As the brain becomes more accustomed to the porn they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, they have to move on to new and extreme forms of porn to get aroused. Thus the porn a user consumes changes over time.
For instance, who in their right mind starts out watching child porn? You can read story after story of men who\xe2\x80\x99ve gone to jail for child porn who claim they started out with the \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d stuff. I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying if you watch porn, you\xe2\x80\x99ll end up with an FBI agent at your door because you got into kiddie porn, but the research is scary. In a 2012 survey of 1,500 young adult men, 56% said their tastes in porn had become \xe2\x80\x9cincreasingly extreme or deviant.\xe2\x80\x9d
That alone should worry you.
In college and the military, a common phrase I would hear was \xe2\x80\x9cShe wanted it even if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t know it yet.\xe2\x80\x9d In my hey-day I chuckled at the statement and probably said it myself. Of course, we were all watching porn, sharing it, and assumed the behavior was normal. After all, porn emphasized that mentality.
In an article by Non-profit Organization Fight the New Drug they state:
\xe2\x80\xa6a team of researchers looked at 50 of the most popular porn films \xe2\x80\x94 the ones purchased and rented most often. Of the 304 scenes the movies contained, 88% contained physical violence and 49% contained verbal aggression. On average, only one scene in 10 didn\xe2\x80\x99t contain any aggression, and the typical scene averaged 12 physical or verbal attacks. One particularly disturbing scene managed to fit in 128.
But back to those who say to only consume organic, fair trade porn right?
Unfortunately for them, research confirms that those who consume porn (even if it\xe2\x80\x99s nonviolent) are more likely to support statements that promote abuse and sexual aggression toward women. Degrading porn (which I stated earlier people will move into with repeated consumption) increases a user\xe2\x80\x99s dominating and harassing behavior toward others and leaves the user feeling less compassion for rape victims.
If you\xe2\x80\x99re still not convinced, in an article from the Journal of Communication on Pornography Consumption and Actual Acts of Sexual Aggression researchers said the following after examining twenty two studies:
\xe2\x80\x9c There is little doubt that, on the average, individuals who consume pornography more frequently are more likely to hold attitudes conducive to sexual aggression and engage in actual acts of sexual aggression.\xe2\x80\x9d
You can\xe2\x80\x99t. Dutch researchers found porn is the most addictive online activity. The only thing even close is online gambling, and that\xe2\x80\x99s still number two. Also, do an experiment for me. Go a month without porn (if you can) and then come back and tell me how hard it\xe2\x80\x99s been to not look at porn. As a friend once told me, \xe2\x80\x9cAnything you can\xe2\x80\x99t give up owns you.\xe2\x80\x9d
2. \xe2\x80\x9cPorn isn\xe2\x80\x99t really THAT big a deal.\xe2\x80\x9d
Porn revenue exceeds that of the NFL, MLB, and NBA combined. It also exceeds the revenue of television networks CBS, NBC, and ABC combined. Child porn generates three billion dollars annually and the number one searched type of porn on the internet is \xe2\x80\x9cteen.\xe2\x80\x9d Seems like a big deal.
3. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the porn industry\xe2\x80\x99s fault!\xe2\x80\x9d
Not really. This is supply and demand. People understand the risks associated with cigarettes and still use them. Porn is legal (for the most part) and regulated to some degree. However, most people don\xe2\x80\x99t understand how supply and demand for porn has such a dark side. As stated, its side effects can lead to sexual aggression, the exploitation of women and children (more common than men), and fuels the sex trafficking industry. The fault lies on those of us who continue to ignore the research while letting our minds and emotions become warped to the point of indifference and aggression.
If you\xe2\x80\x99re a parent, you should care (the average age a child is exposed to porn is eleven). If you\xe2\x80\x99re a spouse, you should care what it could do to your partner. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to date a guy or girl that might put you in the #metoo category because they love porn, you should care. If you watch porn, you should know and care what the consequences are.
Basically, if you want to build a less violent world and respect your fellow humans, the answer is simple: start taking steps to stop watching porn
Your relationships, love life, and sex life deserve better.
