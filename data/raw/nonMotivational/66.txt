Novel Gazing is Electric Literature\xe2\x80\x99s personal essay series about the way reading shapes our lives. This time, we asked: What book was your feminist awakening?
The painting on the cover stopped me in my tracks, right there in the science fiction/fantasy section of Waldenbooks at Chapel Hill Mall in Akron, Ohio. The central figure is a woman. She\xe2\x80\x99s not naked, nor is she wearing an armored bikini or an approximation of medieval dress that allows for ample cleavage. Instead, she is wearing a voluminous robe, her long, dark hair bound by a simple coronet. She is sitting on a beautiful white horse and grasping a sword by its blade. She looks determined, but serene, fully self-sufficient.
There\xe2\x80\x99s not a man in sight.
And that evocative title! The Mists of Avalon. I\xe2\x80\x99d already read \xe2\x80\x94 and loved \xe2\x80\x94 T. H. White\xe2\x80\x99s The Once and Future King, which had led me to Howard Pyle\xe2\x80\x99s take on Arthurian legend, as well as John Steinbeck\xe2\x80\x99s. I\xe2\x80\x99d even muddled through La Morte d\xe2\x80\x99Arthur. Bradley\xe2\x80\x99s reference to the island where Arthur rests made me feel like an insider, while the marketing copy suggested something radically different than anything I\xe2\x80\x99d encountered before: Arthurian legend, from the female perspective.
I still cannot imagine anything more perfectly aligned with my thirteen-year-old sensibilities than Marion Zimmer Bradley\xe2\x80\x99s masterpiece. Bradley opened my eyes to the idea that, when we look at the past, we are only ever seeing a small part of it \xe2\x80\x94 and usually, what we are seeing excludes the experiences of women. Encountering the vain, self-serving, diabolical Morgan le Fay transformed into the priestess Morgaine compelled me to question other received narratives in which women are to blame for the failures of men. The Mists of Avalon also gave me a glimpse of spiritual possibilities beyond male-dominated, male-defined religions. In retrospect, I can see that it gave me ways of seeing that helped me find the feminine even within patriarchal systems while studying religion as an undergrad. The impact of this book lingers in my feminism, certainly, but it also influenced my scholarly interest in folklore, and it still informs my personal spirituality.
But my primary reaction to The Mists of Avalon, when I first read it, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t intellectual; it was emotional. Like The Once and Future King, Bradley\xe2\x80\x99s novel follows its protagonist from childhood into old age. I sympathized with the girl Morgaine, and her adolescent experiences hinted at frustrations I was just beginning to feel. The moment when Morgaine and Lancelet are, finally, about to become lovers \xe2\x80\x94 and then Gwenhwyfar, blonde and fair and lithe and helpless, stumbles into Avalon\xe2\x80\xa6 No matter how many times I revisit this scene, it still crushes me. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a story about the pretty girl, the princess. It\xe2\x80\x99s the story of the smart girl who becomes a powerful woman. Even so, Bradley brings nuance to these characters. She shows us Morgaine doing foolish, selfish things, and she shows us that Gwenhwyfar\xe2\x80\x99s position is an impossible one. Doom hangs over Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s glorious reign, just as fate rules many a legend and fable. There is no happy ending for anyone at Camelot \xe2\x80\x94 there never has been \xe2\x80\x94 but Bradley shows us real people struggling against their destiny, and she shows us that it\xe2\x80\x99s not just impersonal fortune to blame for their inevitable downfall. Instead, it\xe2\x80\x99s systems of oppression. By the time I left home for a women\xe2\x80\x99s college in 1989, I\xe2\x80\x99d reread The Mists of Avalon several times. I arrived ready to smash the patriarchy.

And then, in 2014, Moira Greyland, Marion Zimmer Bradley\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, told the world that her mother had sexually abused her and many other children for more than a decade. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know how to process this information. I believed Greyland, absolutely, but I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make this revelation fit with The Mists of Avalon and what that book meant to me. Bradley was not an author to whom I had a personal attachment. I\xe2\x80\x99d never gotten into anything she\xe2\x80\x99d written besides The Mists of Avalon. Had I been more of a fan, I might have seen the pedophilia threaded through her other work. I might have known that Walter Breen \xe2\x80\x94 Bradley\xe2\x80\x99s husband and Greyland\xe2\x80\x99s father \xe2\x80\x94 died in prison after being convicted of molesting a child. (Greyland says that there were many, many more victims.) Had I been more of a fan, I might have known that rumors about Bradley and Breen had circulated in the science fiction and fantasy communities for years.
My connection wasn\xe2\x80\x99t with Bradley, though. My connection was with Morgaine and Viviane and Morgause \xe2\x80\x94 the characters Bradley created. When I read Greyland\xe2\x80\x99s story, I immediately thought of one scene in The Mists of Avalon that suddenly seemed suspect, but that was it. Wondering what I might have missed, I decided to read the novel one more time.
The scene that I remembered was right where it had always been:
She stretched out her arms, and at her command she knew that outside the cave, in the light of the fecundating fires, man and woman, drawn one to the other by the pulsating surges of life, came together. The little blue-painted girl who had borne the fertilizing blood was drawn down into the arms of a sinewy old hunter, and Morgaine saw her briefly struggle and cry out, go down under his body, her legs opening to the irresistible force of nature in them.
The sexual act described here takes place around the Beltane fire. As a young reader, I was disturbed by it, but I saw it as a description of people who have passed beyond the normal world and into the sacred time of a fertility ritual. The scene was frightening for me as a child, and repellent, but also, I must admit, fascinating. In context, this passage made sense: The horror of the scene was an element of its power.

And that was all I found. Everything I had always loved about the book was still there, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t find anything new to hate. So, what was I going to do with this book?
This is, of course, a version of the question we\xe2\x80\x99re all asking ourselves at the moment. How do we separate the artist from the art? Should we? Can we? I have found that my own answers vary. Woody Allen\xe2\x80\x99s face makes Annie Hall, Crimes and Misdemeanors, and Hannah and Her Sisters \xe2\x80\x94 all movies I\xe2\x80\x99ve adored \xe2\x80\x94 impossible. I\xe2\x80\x99m also done with Louis C.K., but I\xe2\x80\x99m not even ready to think about the colleagues and collaborators \xe2\x80\x94 Pamela Adlon? Aziz Ansari? \xe2\x80\x94 who have supported him, even as I, myself, was long willing to let \xe2\x80\x9crumors\xe2\x80\x9d be \xe2\x80\x9crumors.\xe2\x80\x9d Losing Kevin Spacey isn\xe2\x80\x99t hard for me, but forswearing Harvey Weinstein forever means forgetting about a long list of great movies. And Weinstein was a producer \xe2\x80\x94 a facilitator more than a creator. Is his connection to a film close enough to make that film anathema?
Jodi Kantor, Megan Twohey, and Ronan Farrow\xe2\x80\x99s reporting on Weinstein seems to be a tipping point for sexual harassment and assault in Hollywood, but we\xe2\x80\x99re also seeing women and men come forward in journalism, publishing, and academia. The question of separating the abuser from his work metastasizes, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any easy answers. Or, rather, I do have one easy answer: When someone says they\xe2\x80\x99ve been assaulted, abused, harassed, I believe them. But I believe them, in part, because of lessons I absorbed from The Mists of Avalon.

So, what to do with this once-beloved book? I\xe2\x80\x99ve read it once since Greyland spoke out, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I will read it again. Probably not, I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing. Discovering that powerful men are predators is disturbing, but not surprising. Learning that the author who introduced me to feminine spirituality and the hidden side of history abused children \xe2\x80\x94 girls and boys, her own daughter \xe2\x80\x94 was horrifying in an existential kind of way. I\xe2\x80\x99m a writer and an editor and I know that characters can exceed their creators. I would go so far as to say that that\xe2\x80\x99s the goal. So I can keep Morgaine \xe2\x80\x94 what she has meant to me, what she has become in my personal mythology \xe2\x80\x94 while I reject Bradley.
I no longer recommend The Mists of Avalon to other readers, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine burdening a child with it. There are other stories. Monica Furlong\xe2\x80\x99s books Wise Child and Juniper are now my go-to titles for youngsters. Manda Scott\xe2\x80\x99s Boudica series are the books that I wish I had found when I was thirteen, and I\xe2\x80\x99m eagerly awaiting the sequel to Nicola Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s Hild. It\xe2\x80\x99s entirely possible that these stories about powerful women might never have been published if not for the success of The Mists of Avalon. This is part of Bradley\xe2\x80\x99s legacy, too. But, even if I can appreciate the extent to which this author created a space for a new kind of writing in fantasy, I am still haunted by the voices she silenced.

When she finally came forward with her story, Greyland said,
[O]ne reason I never said anything is that I regarded her life as being more important than mine: her fame more important, and assuredly the comfort of her fans as more important. Those who knew me, knew the truth about her, but beyond that, it did not matter what she had done to me, as long as her work and her reputation continued.
I believe Moira Greyland. Her life matters more than any fiction.
