Including my own. I know I’m guilty on the pest control front. I don’t want to think too hard about some of the others.', 'We hear all too much about toxic masculinity, that amorphous term that refers to the way traits like aggression and emotional repression are baked into male social norms. It also frequently shows up in online feminism as lazy shorthand for registering disapproval of just about anything men do at all. But when are we going to grant equal rights to women and admit that toxic femininity also exists and can be just as poisonous?', 'There are minor forms of feminine toxins, like blaming irrational temper tantrums on “being hormonal” or feigning helplessness in order to get what you want. And there are major toxins, many having to do with weaponizing your fragility so that those to whom you cause harm have a difficult time defending themselves, lest they look like the aggressors. Women, of course, can unleash these tactics on other women, be they romantic partners or not. But for the sake of this discussion, let’s say we are talking about women and men and sex. We’ve established that many men are socially conditioned to think that women owe them sex. But what about the women that assume that men should be grateful for any sex they get?', 'In a free society, everyone, regardless of gender, is free to be a manipulative, narcissistic, emotionally destructive asshole.', 'Throughout my life, I’ve heard countless men tell stories about going ahead with sex even though they didn’t really want to. Sometimes, it was because they didn’t want to hurt the woman’s feelings. Other times, it was because they feared being perceived as having a low sex drive.', 'A remarkable number of men have told me about times when women approached them and, often wordlessly, initiated sexual encounters without the slightest provocation or questions asked. I’ve heard, more than once, about unsolicited hand jobs on school buses when they were boys. Also, more than once, men have told me about past grade school camping trips or overnight parties wherein girls they barely knew slipped into their sleeping bags or beds. In some cases, the men were happy to oblige the women’s desires. In other cases, though, they went through with the encounters because they didn’t want to make an awkward situation even more awkward.', 'These stories have been relayed to me in a tone I can only describe as bafflement. The men are not complaining, but nor are they boasting. If anything, they seem to be struggling to find the words to describe a not-entirely-welcome encounter that they felt they had no right to regard with anything other than gratitude. Needless to say, if you imagined any of these situations with the genders reversed, you’d have the potential for very different framing.', 'I realize that the physical size difference between most women and most men means that the above comparison isn’t entirely fair; a woman who’s sexually aggressive with a man is probably not putting him in insurmountable physical danger. And I’m cognizant of the fact that for every bad behavior I mentioned in my opening list of questions there is an equal, opposite, and potentially more physically threatening form of bad behavior that men can, and do, visit upon women with just as much frequency.', 'But that, right there, is precisely my point. In a free society, everyone, regardless of gender, or any other identification, is free to be a manipulative, narcissistic, emotionally destructive asshole. So I’m not sure why men have been getting all the credit lately.', 'The #BelieveWomen memes that have arisen in the wake of #MeToo in general, and the Brett Kavanaugh saga in particular, are coming from a place of empathy and good intentions. But they’re also stripping women of our complications and contradictions, and therefore our humanity.', 'For what it’s worth, I believed Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony about what happened between her and Kavanaugh when they were in high school. It is my personal belief, based on nothing more than gut feeling, that things transpired more or less as Ford described them and that Kavanaugh was too drunk at the time to remember. I believe that Kavanaugh effectively lied under oath about the extent of his drinking, and that this alone should have disqualified him from holding a seat on the Supreme Court.', 'But there is a difference between believing and knowing. Even if the judiciary committee had done the right thing and subpoenaed Mark Judge, who witnessed the encounter between Ford and Kavanaugh, and forced him to testify under oath, no one would ever have known definitively what happened that evening. All the truth digging in the world will not change the fact that all kinds of people misrepresent, misremember, misinterpret, and willfully or unwillfully make misleading statements for all kinds of reasons.', 'And that is why #BelieveWomen, with its suggestion that women are some monolithic entity that is inherently more moral, innocent, or trustworthy than men, is not just reductive but insulting. Women are not simple, guileless creatures to whom only the most innocent motives should ever be ascribed. Both sexes contain multitudes. Or, as George Carlin put it, “Men are from Earth, women are from Earth. Deal with it.”', '#MeToo is important. #BelieveWomen is hollow sloganeering.', 'My opening list of “raise your hand” questions surely set some teeth on edge. It’s difficult to talk about things like women tricking men into getting them pregnant, not least of all because it makes you sound like a part of the men’s rights movement — a loosely knit and often self-defeating enterprise that overrides legitimate grievances about, say, the family court system, with ambient misogyny and conspiracy theories. When I was in my twenties, just hearing a phrase like “tricking men” would have made me assume it was coming from a woman-hating kook.', 'But the thing about growing older is that over the years, you run into more and more people and see all the different kinds of havoc they can wreak. I know men who, amid contentious divorce proceedings, have been accused, preposterously, of spousal and child abuse. I know women who are so skilled in the dark art of gaslighting that the targets of their mind games, be it boyfriends or BFFs, don’t stand a chance. Once, while working with high school students, I overheard some girls joking to one another about how they were going to go out that night and “hit on older guys who don’t know we’re underage and later be like ‘Dude, you’re a pedophile.’”', 'I decided to give the girls the benefit of the doubt and assume they were just goofing around, condemning misogynist stereotypes about young women as jailbait by ironically reclaiming those stereotypes. Along the way, I tried to think like a good feminist and consider that patriarchal societies foster or even force this kind of manipulative female behavior because it’s often the only power available to women.', 'But that’s an excuse and a poor one. Some women act abominably because some people act abominably.', 'The famous line “Feminism is the radical notion that women are people” has been popping up on bumper stickers and T-shirts since the 1980s. But in 2018, many feminists seem illogically invested in the idea that women operate under a different set of standards and practices than men and might, in fact, be something rather separate from “people.” They will say this is because women are still often reduced to second-class citizens; underpaid in the labor force, underrepresented in politics, and undermined and ignored when, like Ford, they speak up about their experiences.', 'But can we please put this into some perspective? There is now an entire literary genre — and, more than that, vast quarters of the mainstream media — devoted to women speaking up about their experiences. Every day, the stories roll across my news feeds faster than I could possibly read them, their headlines tweaked to clickbait perfection. “Thanks for not raping us, all you ‘good men.’ But it’s not enough,” went the headline of a Washington Post guest opinion column earlier this month.', 'Meanwhile, when men speak up about what it’s like to be accused of sexual misconduct — or just navigate the sexual arena in general — the only culturally sanctioned response is to paint them as entitled whiners at best and narcissistic and, of course, toxic sociopaths at worst.', '#MeToo is important. #BelieveWomen is hollow sloganeering that will ultimately set us back rather than move us forward. Like all movements, #MeToo will live or die by the degree to which it’s willing to let people in. Until it makes room for examinations not just of toxic masculinity but also toxic femininity—and, even better, dispatch with these meaningless terms—it will continue to tell only half the story. Until it admits that women can be as manipulative and creepy and generally awful as men, the movement will continue to send a message that we’re not really whole people. And why would anyone believe someone like that?']"

Rape culture impacts all women. Severely. The only reason this is treated as less of an epidemic than it is is because there are longstanding mechanisms built into our society (shame, religion, power dynamics, a cultural taboo against shaming men for irresponsible use of their sexuality, etc.) to keep us from speaking out about them.', 'These mechanisms are now falling apart.', 'medium.com', 'Human civilization is made of rape. For millennia, all over the world, women have been commodified and kept as property for the purpose of receiving male reproductive fluids and raising their progeny, regardless of our will. During this time we were kept at home while men invented religion, money, economics, war, government, hierarchy, class, culture, rules, laws and traditions, including the laws of the marital bed. Civilization has been arranged so that each man receives a woman to own, with whom he may have sex whenever he wishes, between building, fighting, destroying and conquering in accordance with the will of whatever ruler happened to be running the show at the time.', 'This is only just now beginning to change. A woman’s will for her own sexuality is only just now becoming culturally relevant, a blink of an eye from a historical perspective.', 'Spousal rape was not considered a crime in all 50 states until 1993, and there are still seven states where there is a marital exception to certain sex crimes.

A third of women reported pain in their last sexual experience. They didn’t just not enjoy it, they gritted their teeth through it. Why? Because for a myriad of reasons, we don’t feel like we have a choice.

Thus far our attempts to shift trajectories have failed spectacularly. If something is going to save us, it’s going to come from way out of left field.', 'Women everywhere feel the significance of the #MeToo phenomenon. A lot of us are scared to say anything about it for fear of hurting the feelings of the men we love, fear of retribution, and fear of being eaten alive by the intimidating, debate-culture defenders of patriarchy, but there’s a widespread sense that this thing is much bigger than it seems. Some leaders of conventional feminist thought have been speculating about some kind of progressive political upheaval, but in my opinion this is infinitely more revolutionary than that. We are about to experience a plunge into completely unknown and uncharted territory.', 'I can’t even keep track of all the men who are facing sexual misconduct accusations anymore as women gain more and more confidence to call it out, but the hyper-politicized nature of the circles I move in tells me it’s entirely bipartisan.

Unfortunately, that’s still mostly true today.', 'We know our sexuality is our spark and our spunk, our creativity, our beauty and our healing. We know a raped woman will lose all these things in the months after the rape, often taking years to get them back. We know that when you scare a woman’s sexuality, you dim her light. And that’s Louis CK’s greatest crime right now, whether he knows it or not. All those female comics that he smeared his smelly sexuality all over? He made them less brave, less fearless, less funny.', 'In a time when we face human extinction, we need all the bravery and humor we can get.', 'There’s a certain type of personality that finds it deeply offensive that I talk about rape culture sometimes.

Sexual predation is no longer shrouded by any taboos against pointing at it and calling it what it is. Complain all you want — this upheaval is coming either way.', 'This is not a political or ideological revolution. This is a complete undoing of all that is sick in this world, coming not from our minds but from deep within our cells. A voice has finally been given to the heritage of pain which has been passed from mother to daughter from generation to generation as we taught one another how to survive in a world of sexual slavery since the dawn of civilization.

It will roar, and it will destroy.', 'Change is coming. What looks like women talking about their experiences with rape culture is actually a vast area of endarkened human unconsciousness suddenly becoming enlightened into consciousness. A whole section of our collective consciousness which we have never previously had access to is now suddenly becoming available to us.

Instead of telling a story of sexual harassment, I showed it via two photos from my college thesis project, “Shooting Back” (1986–88), with a quick tossed-off line: “#MeToo, too many times to count. With photographic evidence, even.”', '“Shooting Back” began as an exercise in self-therapy, after a stranger broke into my dorm room and then broke me. (I’d also been mugged at gunpoint twice, once with my friend John, another time alone, as well as kicked unconscious on a busy street while walking home at 9 PM from the library, as well as sexually assaulted by a group of drunk men while walking home from a video store. But I digress.) The photos in “Shooting Back” were of men who’d harassed me on the street. After they’d say, “Hey, baby, wanna get it on?” I’d say, “No, thank you, but I would like to shoot your photo.” I had a Nikkormat with a single fixed 28-millimeter lens back then, so that’s what I used. Meaning, to do this project, I had to get up in their faces, super close, and use my camera as a weapon. It was a small shift in the power dynamic, but it was my own form of grace and reclamation, turning hunter into prey.', 'That college thesis — that transformation of my hidden pain into visible art — launched my career. It was published in Boston Magazine, PHOTO, and Photomagazine. It was nominated for a W. Eugene Smith Award. It landed me a spot as one of only two females exhibited at the first Visa Pour L’Image photojournalism festival in Perpignan, France. It got my foot in the door at the photo agencies and publications that sent me to Israel, then Afghanistan and beyond.', 'The two photos I posted on Sunday night were unusual for the series, as they were acts of sexual harassment caught in medias res. One was of men in wolf masks who’d chased me down a street in downtown Boston. And then there was the man in Boston’s Combat Zone who’d said, “Hey, baby, wanna get it on,” and I’d said, “No, thank you, but I would like to shoot your photo,” but before I could approach him with my 28-millimeter lens, he flashed me. So I quickly shot the photo from five feet away and ran.', 'An hour after posting these two photos on Facebook, I was informed that I’d been suspended from the social media site for 24-hours for posting “content that threatens or promotes sexual violence or exploitation.” The admonition went further: “Where appropriate,” it said, “we refer this content to law enforcement.” I was hurt, horrified, and, frankly, re-traumatized. The image of that flasher has nothing to do with “promoting sexual violence or exploitation” and everything to do with unmasking it, because how often does one get documentary proof of sexual predation? Almost never. And that’s one of the most insidious part of sexual harassment: its utter invisibility.', 'It’s like all of us women are Big Birds, and there’s this giant mastodon of sexual predation only we can see. But finally, here was proof. Snuffleupagus exists! And here’s a photo of a flasher to prove it.', 'It’s been 30 years since I shot “Shooting Back,” and we’re finally talking about male predatory behavior toward women in a way that feels different, more urgent, thanks to Harvey Weinstein’s outrageous use of it. It hasn’t stopped for me, nor for any of us. I lost a column and a bit of decent extra income recently, after not answering my editor’s email, in which he wrote, in response to my email asking what time the staff pizza party began, “1 PM. How come you’ve never asked me out?” But until Alyssa Milano suggested Tarana Burke’s decade-old #MeToo hashtag, until all of our social media feeds were flooded with stories of inappropriate male behavior and predation, I’m not sure how many men truly understood our silent pain: the aggressions themselves, of course, but also the cone of silence, the lack of evidence, the fear of being labeled a woman who cries wolf. Only in this case, I had the wolves to prove it! I wasn’t just crying wolf. I was showing them to you.', 'And then, as usual in this endless game of wolf and prey, I was summarily punished for exposing them.', '***UPDATE 10/19/17, 6:45 AM: In the comments below, a man named Brad Cook from Facebook saw this story and took swift action to restore the original content. Thank you, Brad! I appreciate it. I’ve made suggestions as to how this might be avoided in the future in my response to your comment.']"

Everybody has a story on the eclectic curriculum they were offered, the epiphanies they had. I can’t recall my eighth grade math teacher’s name, but I remember the venereal disease slideshow, a classmate who claimed that a woman’s breasts “stiffen” when she’s aroused, and the time we had a sexual assault hotline operator show up to explain what rape is. She impressed upon us the sheer atrocity of these crimes, as well as the long-term damage endured by victims.', 'Well into this lecture, she informed us that men can be victims, too, and started giving examples. She then arrived at an anecdote that changed her whole demeanor. It was about a man whose girlfriend handcuffed him to their bed and started inserting foreign objects into his rectum — painfully and against his protests. As the woman listed the items used, including a pencil, she was taken by a giggling fit. “I’m sorry,” she gasped, “It’s not funny, I shouldn’t laugh.” But she did, and so did the class. I cannot forget the queasy jolt this laughter gave me. It was clear that although we had to be grimly mature in discussing the terrifying abuse and violence women face, a man suffering that way could be viewed as a weird exception, if not an outright absurdity. He’s a punchline.', 'There are many reasons why victims of harassment or physical abuse don’t always come forward right away, depending on factors too numerous to mention. Women will of course be pilloried and threatened by corrupt institutions and misogynist trolls for daring to accuse a man, but these antagonists start from the assumption that she’s making it up or actually to blame. With a man, you can acknowledge the incident as reported — we have no problem trusting a man’s version of reality — while still brushing it off as a joke.', 'This is happening right now to the actor Brendan Fraser, who in February went public with an allegation that Philip Berk, a one-time president of the powerful Hollywood Foreign Press Association, groped his buttocks and poked his perineum (in Fraser’s telling, his “taint”), even wiggling a finger around in the sensitive area. This was in 2003, in a crowded area of the Beverly Hills Hotel, in public view. The violation had Fraser “overcome with panic and fear,” though Berk gladly related the episode in his memoir, leaving out the finger part and characterizing the ass-grab as a playful pinch.', 'The HFPA promised to investigate Fraser’s claims; three months later, they showed him their proposed follow-up statement. It read, in part: “Although it was concluded that Mr. Berk inappropriately touched Mr. Fraser, the evidence supports that it was intended to be taken as a joke and not as a sexual advance.” Again: It happened, everyone agrees it happened, but, well, it doesn’t count, because a man touching another man inappropriately can only be a gay come-on or good-humored bonding behavior.', 'Since the HFPA ruled out the former, it had to be the latter. This homophobic binary conveniently omits the potential for psychological intimidation or control — the pure “alpha” move, as it were. Yet we know this power imbalance is the dark center of countless #MeToo stories, even when the victims are men. The actor Anthony Rapp recalled, when just 14 years old and younger-looking than that, how a 26-year-old Kevin Spacey “picked me up like a groom picks up the bride over the threshold” and pressed him down on a bed, arms tightening around his body until he was able to squirm away. Spacey’s now-infamous response attempted to paint a scene of unfortunate drunken buffoonery, then pivoted to “reveal” his sexual orientation in order to deflect from the disturbing particulars of Rapp’s account. He became an instant #MeToo casualty, but we never quite reckoned with his choice to target and trap a kid. In India, where child rape has reached epidemic proportions, it is this exact unwillingness to confront a taboo same-sex dynamic which deepens the crisis: While rapists of girls under 12 years old can receive the death penalty, there’s no equivalent law concerning assault on boys.', 'Fraser has rejected the HFPA ruling and declined to sign the would-be “joint” statement, saying, “I don’t get the joke.” He was not allowed to read the report of the the investigation or obtain information as to how they reached the conclusion they did. Berk confirmed that to date he remains a voting member of the association and has not been disciplined by the leadership in any way. This is all familiar enough: Thrown into the spotlight by a #MeToo article, the organization that always turned a blind eye to these problems craves a return to the status quo. It therefore pretends to police itself, quietly, and with rather opaque methods, delivering a verdict that ensures nothing will change. Addressing Fraser’s dissatisfaction with their favored spin, the HFPA nonetheless fed the media a denial of wrongdoing, citing their “need to abide by the investigation’s finding that the exchange [with Berk] was not an intended sexual advance.” Still they insist the relative gayness of the groping is the sole metric for determining harm; still they ignore the countless nonsexual implications, professional or personal, of such an encounter. Their job was never to assess whether Berk wanted to sleep with Fraser, and still the statement rests on assurances of Berk’s geniality. Missing this time, however, was the critical word that drew Fraser’s attention in the original draft: “joke.”', 'That word carried an awful weight. It said that while women are to be permitted, in a small degree, their righteous anger at predatory men of influence, victimized men have a duty to reframe the same trauma as homosocial horseplay. To not add fuel to the fire when it’s already burning hot. To get over it, because men are tough, resilient, unemotional. That “joke” bore the stain of YouTube dudeworld, in which any transgression is theoretically undone with the desperate, magical phrase, “It’s just a prank, bro!” It alludes to a history of movies and TV shows that take the tragedy of prison rape as an opportunity for lighthearted innuendo, to the casual sadism of college hazing ceremonies and teen boys who make a sport of half-malicious, half-affectionate “nut taps.” It told Fraser to overrule his visceral understanding of what was no doubt an attempt to dominate and demean him — the hunky leading man as a hunk of meat, owned in full by Hollywood’s behind-the-scenes brokers — and tell the world it was funny.', 'This is how we victim-blame men: not for drinking too much or wearing the wrong clothes or seeking salacious fame, but for not playing along when another guy crosses a line. The villains here invoke the same fraternity of silence that gaslights and suppresses female victims. Terry Crews, an actor with a #MeToo story much like Fraser’s, shared an email from the music producer Russell Simmons, who advised him to give his abuser “a pass,” as if the assault had happened to someone else, unknown to either man, and then, in a way, nonexistent. To do so would have reinforced the toxic assumption that men are invulnerable to these attacks — that to be a victim is, essentially, to be a woman.', 'This is the ineluctable terminus of the archaic gender essentialism that says: If you’re not strong enough to swallow your suffering, you’re not a man. The courage Crews and Fraser have shown is their willingness to drill through that, and the danger they present to the establishment is the revelation that rape culture hurts everyone, not just women. Being who they are, saying what they say, they dissolve the argument that #MeToo is no more than a hysterical “witch hunt” or propaganda cooked up by radical feminists. They don’t fit the reactionary narrative.', 'If we’re shocked that tall, well-muscled, manly stars are instantly diminished and humiliated by predators in high places and stay silent for years, that’s a measure of how we overrate their bodies and undervalue their inner lives, all in the name of destructive gender norms. If we regard these encounters as implausible, since they don’t result in an explosion of stereotypically masculine rage (Why didn’t he just punch the guy in the face?), then the guilty parties will easily discount them as unreal.', 'But the accused doesn’t set the meaning of their offense, and it’s detestable to use the specter of homosexuality to influence our reading, whether Spacey trots out his identity for sympathy or Berk tells the HFPA that he grabbed Fraser’s butt without a stirring of arousal. At a crossroads for sexual politics where belief is invaluable, doubt is the most dangerous weapon, and the male code dividing “gay” from “no homo” is a smokescreen that creates it. Don’t let these excuses for the inexcusable distract from the #MeToo men’s united message: No one is immune to abuse, nor to the shame and hopelessness that come with it, and no one can be expected to bury that for anyone.', 'Miles Klee is a staff writer at MEL.

Right now many men are confused. Some are downright scared. Many believe that women wield a new form of power. Some of these same men accuse women of conducting a witch hunt.

Even Superman’s afraid, if you can believe it.', 'You know things are bad when the Man of Steel quivers.', 'Recently, actor Henry Cavill misspoke in an interview with GQ Australia intended to promote his new movie Mission Impossible: — Fallout. His words lit a firestorm of controversy related to the #MeToo Movement. Asked about his thoughts on the movement, Cavill said:', 'There’s something wonderful about a man chasing a woman. There’s a traditional approach to that, which is nice. I think a woman should be wooed and chased, but maybe I’m old-fashioned for thinking that.', 'That’s not a bad sentiment. If anything, it’s a perfectly harmless throwback expression of masculinity. But then the Superman actor went on to add:', 'It’s very difficult to do that if there are certain rules in place. Because then it’s like: ‘Well, I don’t want to go up and talk to her, because I’m going to be called a rapist or something’. So you’re like, ‘Forget it, I’m going to call an ex-girlfriend instead, and then just go back to a relationship, which never really worked’.

And rightfully so.', 'But what is so wrong with Cavill’s statements? After all, many men these days feel exactly the same way.', 'The better question to ask is this: Why is Superman afraid of being called a rapist? Are false sexual assault allegations the new kryptonite? Not exactly.', 'This comic book metaphor is a wholly incorrect (and adolescent) way of looking at our modern moment. First, women aren’t wielding any new power. We haven’t eradicated abuse, harassment, and rape. The only change is that the world is finally, rightfully, listening to women, and holding their abusers, harassers, and rapists accountable. That’s huge. That’s good. We want more of that.', 'Those who claim the #MeToo Movement has gone too far, that it’s morphed into a witch hunt, are focusing on the wrong aspects of sexual abuse. The #MeToo Movement has one simple aim: Make the world safer for women by ensuring women are free from sexual harassment, abuse, assault, and rape. This goal can’t go “too far.”', 'Yet some men, and even some women, think it already has, or will. Although the hashtag originally conceived by Tarana Burke came about more than ten years ago, the recent heat and light generated by the #MeToo conversation in our culture is not even a year old, yet they already want to discuss the hypothetical dangers for men. Instead, we need to focus on how #MeToo brings justice to victims of abuse, harassment, assault, and rape. To stop future abuse.', 'After some reflection, Henry Cavill seems to have realized this truth. Or at least his handlers and PR people urged him to see the error in his statements. He was quick to apologize.', 'But let’s not pick on Cavill, who genuinely seems like a decent and old-fashioned guy (at least according to his self-assessment). He is by no means alone in fearing and criticizing the #MeToo Movement. Fellow action stars Matt Damon and Liam Neeson have both made clumsy statements that were met with condemnation. Damon, who often expresses himself in ham-fisted ways, blundered into a self-made controversy back in December. In January, Neeson called the #MeToo Movement “something of a witch hunt.”', 'But it’s not just men who’ve criticized #MeToo as a witch hunt, Damon and Neeson were soon followed by French actress Catherine Deneuve, who said the exact same thing. She also quickly apologized and walked back her remarks after experiencing a backlash.', 'You know who also labelled the #MeToo Movement a witch hunt?', 'Bill Cosby’s lawyers. If you’re on the same side of an argument as Bill Cosby’s lawyers, that alone should tell you something.', 'But here, let’s go one further. Kanye West’s friend and socio-political mentor, Candace Owens, wanted to add her two cents. She tweeted:', 'Thankfully, to dispel Owens’ nonsensical two-cent notion that definitions have been blurred, we have all-around badass gentleman, Terry Crews. Though he once shared Henry Cavill’s mistaken criticisms and misplaced fears, his wife helped him see what matters most.', 'Do you see how it became crystal clear to Crews? He stopped focusing on himself, and instead, he started to focus on the countless victims of sex crimes.', 'Crews reminds us all, men and women alike, to do two things. In the era of #MeToo, we must get in the habit of listening to women. We must believe women. Always. As a matter of habit. Will there be exceptions to the rule? Absolutely. But this is the new rule: listen to women. Essentially, men need to re-dedicate themselves to respecting women as our equals, our partners.', 'You always want to believe your partner.

What if I take a picture with her and suddenly my hand–', 'I’ll stop you right there. Don’t be that guy. Don’t come up with wild-ass hypotheticals. Last week, video game developer Mark Kern attracted an online backlash after he tweeted something intending to highlight the difficult position modern men are in when it comes to approaching women:', 'Kern then added another kinky robotic condition that would arise from men surrendering control as partners:', 'To conclude his thread, Kern admits that hyperbole is not a real solution. Rather, it’s intended as satire. (He’s sure asking the word satire to do a lot of work in this instance.)', 'Satire or not, Kern overlooks a huge loophole in his knee-jerk logic. If men who are sexually interested in women are “not mind readers,” then how did we get along before? Did Kern and, by extension, all straight men, just sort of blunder forward and hope for the best? What happened if they were wrong? If it turned out that their “first move” was uninvited sexual contact, are we supposed to blame the woman for not giving clear signals? Was it her fault that a man tried to kiss her?', 'See my point? There are two fatal fallacies of the inherent logic of Kern’s (satirical) argument: Blaming victims, and his notion of “mind reading” as a measure of whether a man should initiate a sexual contact makes it clear that in that past:', 'In order to protect men from the possible sting of rejection (or the mistake of not being a “mind reader”), Kern urges us to focus on how we can protect men’s feelings — how to mitigate the potential risk to their careers, reputations, and legacies. But as long as men are excused for their confusion, sex crimes are likely to continue.', 'So let’s clear up any confusion. Look, guys. I promise you can make the first move without any worry of being a sexual abuser or having to go pillar-to-post and say “it’s all up to women” now so that you feel safe. That’s far too simplistic. We’re better than that.', 'No, you don’t have to be a mind reader. You don’t even always need to stop and ask, “Can I kiss you?” But if you feel unsure, perhaps you should. A question removes all confusion. It’s far better than pressing on into dangerous uncertainty. Asking “Can I kiss you?” protects both parties in that fraught moment.', 'A sexual interaction is never just about the initiator. Like, obviously, right? We all get that. It’s about everyone involved. Never lose sight of this. You and your proposed sexual partner are equals. So you must respect women as people, not bed them as conquests whose objections or trepidations must be overcome.', 'This ain’t the mythical Fifties. Women don’t need to maintain their virtue. In case you missed it, women are definitely lusty sexual creatures. They want to get their freak on, too. Trust. But they only want to do it with men they feel comfortable with, men they’re attracted to, men they invite into their physical space.', 'When it comes to sexual interactions with a woman, comfort is key. And it should always be part of your sexual protocol. If she’s not comfortable alone with you, then she definitely doesn’t want you on or in her body. A woman’s comfort is the first step of seduction. You cannot skip past that.', 'Here. Just flip it for a second.', 'Imagine if some woman you weren’t interested in latched herself onto your lips like an Aliens face-hugger and started tongue-punching you without your permission. Or she groped your crotch in some fumbling attempt to feel your junk through your jeans. You would feel violated, right? You would feel assaulted, correct? Now flip it back it around. Do you want to be the Aliens face-hugger? Nah, son. You do not. So don’t be.', 'Also, you should never try to cajole or beg or coax or coerce or guilt or leverage with power or contractual obligations, whether explicit or implied, a woman into giving you sexual attention or repaying your kindness or loyalty with sexual favors. Don’t ever be that guy. He’s a punk-ass. He’s an abuser. Even if “it’s all legal.”', 'If you’re looking for guaranteed sexual interaction, hire a sex worker. That’s their job.', 'Otherwise, you are always dealing with an adult woman, one who has her own sexual agenda, and you need her agenda to align with yours. As equals. Simple.', 'But let’s move past any vague set of Musts and Don’ts. For any man reading this who feels confused about how to approach a woman, how to converse with a woman in a sexual manner, or how to initiate sexual contact, there are ways to do this right, to do it well, and to do it effectively.', 'In that same GQ Australia interview, actor Henry Cavill shares his personal guide to being a gentleman, one who lives at the top of his game. Cavill keeps in his cell phone a list of 100 bullet points on how to be the best man you can be. Many of his rules are well-articulated and highly useful. Some of Cavill’s bullet points recommend:', '19. Be the most positive and enthusiastic person you know.', '20. Loosen up; relax. Except for rare life-or-death matters, nothing is as important as it first seems.', '26. Be modest. A lot was accomplished before you were born.', 'And perhaps most important:', '41. Show respect for everyone who works for a living, regardless of how trivial their job.', 'Show respect for everyone. This includes your potential sexual partners. But how can you show respect for women in the era of #MeToo and still act in a sexualized manner without being labelled an abuser, a harasser, or a rapist?', 'It’s way easier than you think.', 'Be a gentleman.', 'In 1860, Cecil B. Hartley wrote The Gentlemen’s Book of Etiquette and Manual of Politeness. His advice for gentlemen is as timely today as it was just before the start of the Civil War — but to help you out, I added a modern update in italics. This way, you can see that while things change, sexual etiquette remains the same. Consider these the new-old rules of sexual engagement.', '1. “Never join a lady whom you may meet, without first asking her permission to do so.”', 'A gentleman should always ask a woman if his presence is welcome.', 'Example: “Is anyone sitting here? Would you mind if I joined you?”', '2. “In meeting a lady do not offer to shake hands with her, but accept her hand when she offers it for you to take.”', 'Definitely never initiate physical contact with a woman first. Always allow her to be the first to do so.', 'Example: When at a bar (or other social space where flirtation is expected), do not touch a woman until she’s first touched you. Sounds kinda Victorian, right? It’s not. Touch is intimate. It’s a means of flirting. If she likes you, she will let you know, likely with a playful touch. Let her initiate that game.', '3. “When inviting a lady to dance, if she replies very politely, asking to be excused, as she does not wish to dance (‘with you,’ being probably her mental reservation), a man ought to be satisfied. At all events, he should never press her to dance after one refusal.”', 'Learn to gracefully take “No” as answer, without acting like a colossal ass. And never insult her for saying “No.” It’s always her right to do so.', 'Example: If you approach a woman in a public space and she blows you off, just wish her a good day and walk on…like a gentleman.', '4. “The lady who was so very amiable to you last night, has a right to ignore your existence to-day. In fact, a ballroom acquaintance rarely goes any further, until you have met at more balls than one. A prudent man will never presume on a girl’s liveliness or banter.”', 'Just because she was chill with you yesterday doesn’t mean you should expect anything today. A woman always reserves the right to change her mind. In other words, women don’t owe you shit.', '5. “Perhaps the true definition of a gentleman is this: ‘Whoever is open, loyal, and true; whoever is of humane and affable demeanor; whoever is honorable in himself, and in his judgment of others, and requires no law but his word to make him fulfill an engagement; such a man is a gentleman, be he in the highest or lowest rank of life, a man of elegant refinement and intellect, or the most unpolished tiller of the ground.’”', 'To be a gentleman requires that you be respectful, graceful, and most of all, gentle. Imagine what cinematic gentleman Cary Grant might do. Then, do that.', '6. “True courtship consists in a number of quiet, gentlemanly attentions, not so pointed as to alarm, not so vague as to be misunderstood.”', 'Be clear in your approach and intent, and always keep your words and actions gentleman-ly smooth.', 'Example: Before you initiate any sexual contact, check to see that she’s comfortable in your presence. If she’s never physically touched you in a playful way, then, my man, she ain’t into you. You need that clearance, that tacit permission, before you ever think of pressing your lips or hands onto her body. Call it a consent check.', 'Let’s conclude with a quote from my homie, Cecil B. Hartley. He speaks to the undeniable power of gentleness:', 'The progressive dawn of day, the flow of the tide, the lapse of time, the changes of the seasons — these are carried on by slow and imperceptible degrees, yet their progress and issue none can mistake or resist. Equally certain and surprising are the triumphs of gentleness.', 'You see how that plays out, right? With the flow of respect and the touch of grace, the correct order of events and the right sequence of actions, man, you need not worry you’ll be misinterpreted as a harasser, or labeled an abuser, or called a rapist. Besides, gentleness is way more effective than conquest. It gets more done. Trust me on that. A confident gentleman is, and always will be, sexy AF. Ain’t nothing changed about that.', 'But if you still don’t feel like you know how to approach a woman in the #MeToo era, visualize yourself doing this easy step-by-step:', 'Start by saying “Hi.” Then, follow that with a joke, or a compliment not based on her body. If she responds favorably, enjoy a flirtatious conversation. But if she doesn’t have time for you, if she rebuffs your initial greeting, wish her a good day, and get on with your life.', 'Trust that women are sexual beings, too. They don’t need you to overcome their objections. They don’t want you to convince them to have sex. They’re not looking for a surprise, some out-of-the-blue kiss, an unsolicited dick pic, or a nasty comment. There’s no need for a modern man to be an aggressor. Be her partner. You know, like a dance partner. You wouldn’t yank your dance partner around the floor and call it fun. Instead, you want to be graceful, smooth, and moving in time.', 'Before you press your body onto anyone else in a sexual way, the invitation from them should always be as clear to you as the sun in the sky. Just like there’s no mistaking the presence of the sun, there should be no mistaking a woman’s sexual interest in you.', 'It’s really just that simple. Whether you’re a regular man or Superman.']"

And overwhelmingly, they’re thin.', 'But 67% of American women are plus size.

You’ll fight me off, but you’ll love every minute of it.', 'The women coming forward are undeniably courageous: young and old, rich and poor, famous and unknown. And overwhelmingly, they’re thin.', 'I was shaken, confused, disoriented. As he spoke, every breath drained from my waiting lungs, siphoned by his certainty that I’d be grateful for his violence. You’ll love every minute of it. The life in my veins seeped from my body into the ground I wished would swallow me whole.', 'Over time, men’s fantasies became part of the fabric of my experience. In the years that followed, more and more men would disclose their desire to assault me. When I told one to stop, in my mid-twenties, he was taken aback. I thought you were liberated. You should be grateful.', 'The menacing ghost of gratitude followed me everywhere. I was queer, which meant I was expected to be sexually flexible, unfettered by boundaries and unlikely to say no, available to be posed in any scene or position needed for men’s gratification. And I was fat, which meant I should be grateful for what I got. Even if it was violent. Even if I didn’t consent.', 'When I finally disclosed this pattern to thinner friends, I anticipated some knowing commiseration, some tools for survival. After all, we’d spent plenty of time developing shared strategies for creepy coworkers and lecherous neighbors. But to many of them, this ravenous violence was a foreign interaction, a reason to call police, run away, tell every woman I knew, do something drastic. Desperate measures.', 'For my thin friends, rape fantasies were an exception, the provenance of a particularly depraved kind of man. For me, they were the rule: so commonplace as to be routine. Around fat women, seemingly any man could be that particularly depraved kind.', 'More troubling were the reactions from thin acquaintances. A family friend and self-proclaimed feminist, upon hearing about this onslaught of fantasies, congratulated me. Isn’t it great to be wanted? And, more troublingly, there’s a lid for every pot. As if I had been disheartened about the selection of men who would take me. As if their violence were a sign of hope. As if it were just a misguided expression of attraction.', 'One friend asked why I hadn’t told anyone sooner. I was surprised by her question when the answer felt so plain. Like many women before me, when I share stories of harassment, catcalling, unwelcome advances, and violence, I am met with pushback. Unlike other women, that resistance comes as a question:', 'Who would want to rape you?', 'While thin women were free to talk about sexual assault as being somehow divorced from desire — rape is about power, not sex — I didn’t have that luxury. As a fat woman, my body was seen as inherently undesirable. Any sexual attention fat women receive is treated as a windfall worthy of congratulations, an erroneous impossibility, or an out-and-out lie. Fat women are expected to be grateful for any expressions that could be mistaken for want, including assault and harassment. We are exposed to an unvarnished kind of desire, its most violent self, because we are expected to hold and nurture whatever scraps of it we’re offered.', 'Sometimes, our harassment takes a more menacing turn, relying on reinforcing our rejection, rather than our assumed gratitude. A fat acquaintance recently told me that, at her workplace, men openly discussed who they would and wouldn’t sleep with. She often heard her own body used as a punchline — colossally undesirable, comically unwanted. “I just wanted to work,” she said. Even when we’re unwanted, harassment still finds us.', 'When fat women do muster the courage to come forward about our experiences with sexual assault, we’re significantly less likely to be believed about our experiences than our thinner counterparts. While thin women face dismal rates of prosecution and conviction for their sexual assaults, fat women are often dismissed out of hand — making it open season on our bodies. The cultural belief that fat women are unlovable, that fat bodies are undesirable, offers a warm Petri dish, a hospitable home for men’s bacterial desires to grow.', 'It took me years to disclose my own experiences. Because, like any woman, I knew that stepping forward would mean standard denials, scrutiny, dismissals. But for all our talk about sexual assault being an act of power, not desire, as a fat woman, I knew that those statements always came with caveats, asterisks, footnotes. I knew that my body was reliably withheld, an obvious exception to the rule.', 'After all, who would want to rape us? We should be grateful.', 'Our national conversation about sexual assault and harassment has become an important flashpoint. Notably, it has been largely led by Hollywood actresses — the Jessica Albas, Salma Hayeks, and Rose McGowans known for their legendary beauty.', 'But in order to flourish, that conversation will have to hold space for women whose leadership we struggle to respect, whose bodies we struggle to embrace. Even those who, in our heart of hearts, we still expect to be grateful. Because if our feminism fails to acknowledge the humanity of 67% of us, who will that victory serve?']"

The strategists who lent their names to his book have now expressed regret, and the backlash against his media appearances and blog continue unabated.', 'Perhaps no one is eager to see Halperin back in politics because of the severity and number of accusations against him: The Game Change author was accused of pressing his erect penis against multiple women, grabbing a woman’s breasts, masturbating in front of a colleague, throwing a woman against a window and, when rejected, calling a woman to tell her she’d never work in media again.', 'Or maybe it’s because Halperin isn’t — and never was — that amazing at his job.

The industries that men were rightfully forced out of have moved on and thrived, oftentimes replacing outed abusers with female employees.', 'We don’t need to keep harassers on the payroll in order to give the world great art, music, writing, or comedy.

It was a surreal experience sitting across from one of the largest names in the porn industry and, on a personal level, someone whose videos I’d seen.', '“He does this,” my friend Craig told me.“Does what?”“Never orders anything. He just scavenges everyone else’s leftovers once they’re done eating.”', 'I continued to observe the man nicknamed “The Hedgehog” pluck fries from his niece’s plate. Then he pulled out an old Motorola flip phone from the pajama pants he wore to the restaurant.', 'Craig motioned to Ron with a subtle nod of his head, “Watch this.”', 'Ron produced a monocle — or a mini telescope, I wasn’t sure — from his jacket to read his text messages.', '“He won’t buy a new phone. God knows he has the money. I keep telling him it’ll be easier to see messages on a smartphone, but…”', '“But I gotta keep up those good Jewish habits!” Ron chimed in.', 'Earlier in the evening, Craig and Ron debated the subject of pornography in front of a large audience in Austin, Texas. I met Craig several years earlier after I took steps to crush the control pornography had over my life. Early in the dot com boom Craig founded an organization named XXXchurch with goal of helping Christians combat their pornography consumption or addiction. As a former youth pastor, many young males in his church shared about their widespread porn usage wreaking hell in their personal lives. At first, the Christian community damn near crucified (and vilified) him, but once the widespread usage hit pastors and led to scandal, they played a different tune. No good deed goes unpunished in Christendom, right?', 'In real life, Craig and Ron are friends. Craig’s kids call him “Uncle Ron” but have no idea what he does. As their friendship formed because of working in the porn industry on separate sides, both took their debate on the road to universities and churches.', 'In all fairness, I felt Ron won the debate that night. He was charming, articulate, and made several candid points. It wasn’t the porn industry’s fault people got hooked or did deviant things. “In fact,” Ron grinned as he held up a gold embossed piece of paper, “here’s a certificate of appreciation from the FBI to our industry. We’ve worked with law enforcement to report minors who’ve ended up in porn and exploited the managers who’ve used minors.”', 'Craig could have gone harder on him, but stuck more to a charismatic presence on the stage focusing on the unrealistic expectations porn promises. Maybe he didn’t have all the stats that night, I never asked. Hell, some of the research was brand new at the time.', 'But it’s not anymore, and what it’s doing to men and women across the globe has a direct impact on why #metoo happened and why we keep seeing repeat stories of the increase in sexual assault and rape culture.', 'It’s no longer the dirty little secret, but the monster rampaging in our society.', 'After the Harvey Weinstein scandal and recent events exposing widespread sexual assault, the public outcry has become overwhelming. I read through numerous articles (and even wrote my own) on the topic, but one thing I found disturbing was the amount of men and women who continued to advocate from porn (whether on Medium or in other media outlets). “Jerk it to responsible porn” one author said as a way to combat sexual assault and support women. “Amateur, non-binary, or one that doesn’t promote violence.” It was like listening to someone tell me there’s such a thing as fair, trade organic porn. It’s been responsibly filmed and no women were degraded in the filming of these sex scenes. Yeah, right.', 'The notion alone is absurd, because how it’s filmed, amateur or not, consenting or not, romantic or not, has nothing to do with what porn usage does neurologically and emotionally.', 'In 2011, leading psychologist Philip Zimbardo released a TEDTalk and subsequent book titled “The Demise of Guys.” One finding in his talk focused on men preferring porn to women and no longer “knowing the difference between making love and doing porn.” He pointed to video games and porn being a new addiction he dubbed “arousal addiction.” Whereas drugs and alcohol you want more of the same, with porn your taste constantly evolves.', 'Additional research supports what Zimbardo found and explains the process like a twisted version of Pavlov’s Dog. People think they’re being entertained, but their brains are busy building connections between the arousal they feel and what’s happening on screen. As the brain becomes more accustomed to the porn they’ve seen, they have to move on to new and extreme forms of porn to get aroused. Thus the porn a user consumes changes over time.', 'For instance, who in their right mind starts out watching child porn? You can read story after story of men who’ve gone to jail for child porn who claim they started out with the “normal” stuff. I’m not saying if you watch porn, you’ll end up with an FBI agent at your door because you got into kiddie porn, but the research is scary. In a 2012 survey of 1,500 young adult men, 56% said their tastes in porn had become “increasingly extreme or deviant.”', 'That alone should worry you.', 'In college and the military, a common phrase I would hear was “She wanted it even if she didn’t know it yet.” In my hey-day I chuckled at the statement and probably said it myself. Of course, we were all watching porn, sharing it, and assumed the behavior was normal. After all, porn emphasized that mentality.', 'In an article by Non-profit Organization Fight the New Drug they state:', '…a team of researchers looked at 50 of the most popular porn films — the ones purchased and rented most often. Of the 304 scenes the movies contained, 88% contained physical violence and 49% contained verbal aggression. On average, only one scene in 10 didn’t contain any aggression, and the typical scene averaged 12 physical or verbal attacks. One particularly disturbing scene managed to fit in 128.', 'But back to those who say to only consume organic, fair trade porn right?', 'Unfortunately for them, research confirms that those who consume porn (even if it’s nonviolent) are more likely to support statements that promote abuse and sexual aggression toward women. Degrading porn (which I stated earlier people will move into with repeated consumption) increases a user’s dominating and harassing behavior toward others and leaves the user feeling less compassion for rape victims.', 'If you’re still not convinced, in an article from the Journal of Communication on Pornography Consumption and Actual Acts of Sexual Aggression researchers said the following after examining twenty two studies:', '“ There is little doubt that, on the average, individuals who consume pornography more frequently are more likely to hold attitudes conducive to sexual aggression and engage in actual acts of sexual aggression.”', 'You can’t. Dutch researchers found porn is the most addictive online activity. The only thing even close is online gambling, and that’s still number two. Also, do an experiment for me. Go a month without porn (if you can) and then come back and tell me how hard it’s been to not look at porn. As a friend once told me, “Anything you can’t give up owns you.”', '2. “Porn isn’t really THAT big a deal.”', 'Porn revenue exceeds that of the NFL, MLB, and NBA combined. It also exceeds the revenue of television networks CBS, NBC, and ABC combined. Child porn generates three billion dollars annually and the number one searched type of porn on the internet is “teen.” Seems like a big deal.', '3. “This is the porn industry’s fault!”', 'Not really. This is supply and demand. People understand the risks associated with cigarettes and still use them. Porn is legal (for the most part) and regulated to some degree. However, most people don’t understand how supply and demand for porn has such a dark side. As stated, its side effects can lead to sexual aggression, the exploitation of women and children (more common than men), and fuels the sex trafficking industry. The fault lies on those of us who continue to ignore the research while letting our minds and emotions become warped to the point of indifference and aggression.', 'If you’re a parent, you should care (the average age a child is exposed to porn is eleven). If you’re a spouse, you should care what it could do to your partner. If you don’t want to date a guy or girl that might put you in the #metoo category because they love porn, you should care. If you watch porn, you should know and care what the consequences are.', 'Basically, if you want to build a less violent world and respect your fellow humans, the answer is simple: start taking steps to stop watching porn', 'Your relationships, love life, and sex life deserve better.', '**Author’s Note: The research on the topic of pornograhy consumption is extensive and vast. Many organization have done their fair share of reporting peer reviewed research. Should you like to review the research you can visit Fight the New Drug facts page or Truth About Porn.']"

We won’t get anywhere if we keep coddling white feelings.', 'The legacy of white domestic terrorism begins with the broader colonialism and imperialism committed all throughout the world, expands with hate groups like the ku klux klan, and narrows down to individuals (the “lone wolf”) or small groups like the unabomber (1980s-1990s), those who committed the columbine massacre (1990), the Charleston massacre shooter (2015), the Planned Parenthood shooter (2015), and more recently the Portland Islamophobe (2017). And to add to it, all of this is only fueled further by the so-called “Alt Right,” or the renewed white nationalist and white supremacist movements led by 45 and his merry bandits.', '“Black people have too many people relying on us and too much to lose to do the shit that white domestic terrorists do.”', 'What do Black kids do? Misdemeanors? Yes. Definitely.', 'Drug related crimes? Yes. Definitely.', 'Violent crime? Yes. Definitely.', 'The difference is that while Black folks and whites use drugs at similar rates, Black folks are disproportionately caught, punished, and sentenced. Even the reporting and research on whites is more sympathetic, discussing “economic anxiety” as a justification for racism or a “sea of despair” that must be solved, as opposed to many times the United States government willingly lied about drug use among Black folks. In their own words (don’t skip past this quote):', '“The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”', 'The history of Black folks committing crimes like robbery, theft, and even and what some folks like to call “Black-on-Black” crime — a misnomer, as crime is most commonly intraracial — is often related to economic fights over resources. This is not to excuse what we classify as a “crime,” as the category itself requires much interrogation. For example, not paying money bail is a crime punishable by jail time, essentially criminalizing poverty. We need to reconsider and decolonize our understanding of what crime is, what the sources are, and why folks commit crimes.', 'We need to think about why a gang member would shoot a rival gang member over something that could be seen as small. Our judgement around theft, particularly when it is for basic needs for oneself or one’s children, requires a new perspective. How are people pushed into crime? What alternative opportunities do they have? How does gentrification and housing displacement fuel poverty, violent crime, theft, and houselessness?', 'Black youth need therapy, but they need it for a whole different reason than some of these white kids sippin’ on the wine of white supremacy do. Most, if not all, Black Americans deal with general anxiety disorder and many deal with PTSD. Pulling off the stunts white folks pull requires comfortability, or as my friend Joel writes, “it takes an immense amount of privilege and security to function in a vacuum.”', '“The steadily increasing rate of white domestic terrorism should not just be frightening for those of us who have historically been marginalized, it should scare white folks as well.”', 'I’m no psychologist, but it seems to me that folks like the Charleston shooter seek martyr or even vanguard status to show that they will not let “their women” be taken by Black men, or that they will no longer stand by as folks ruin “their country.” A cursory examination of white domestic terrorism in the U.S. reveals that it is often not rooted in a need — food, shelter, water — but instead in violent ideologies that do not help them, but instead hurt others.', 'In comparison, a Black American person would rarely attempt the sorts of feats white American domestic terrorists successfully achieve for many reasons. The primary reason, in my assessment, is that we are afraid of becoming the next modern day lynching. As a Black queer man I wept for Orlando, and as that same Black queer man I broke down as I followed the case of Sandra Bland, even after learning about her homophobia. In other words, why the fuck would a Black person gonna even attempt any of these stunts when we know that the police kill us for everything from a hand to a turning signal.', 'Whiteness works as a shield that works across all economic classes to embolden the spectrum of white humans from dirt poor to mega rich. Class shifts the way whiteness is experienced, as a “trailer trash” white person is not the same as a wealthy white capitalist. They do not possess the same opportunities or socialization, but they do still maintain the white entitlement that leads to dangerous consequences. That is how whiteness protects both the “redneck” and the proud bourgeois alike, giving them a sense of unearned security. It’s wild that white folks have everything at their fingertips and yet they still hunt down ethnic, sexual, and religious minorities. Or shoplift, not for necessity, but for the thrill of it.', 'Black folks and many more historically marginalized groups across the entire globe have a lot to be angry about, but we are often remain quiet. But it doesn’t matter if there is 1 or 1,000: there are a number of white folks that truly want to exterminate non-white, non-straight, non-cis gender, non-American, and/or non-Christian folks for merely existing. This should not just concern Black folks in America, but everyone. Needless to say: we are tired.']"

It’s a rollercoaster ride of grief and gut punches with no reprieve, each episode compounding the violence of racism in escalating beats to a frustrating and exhausting anti-climax that surely would’ve ended in even more horror if allowed to run a minute more.', 'The racialized violence of Them is like watching the opening-bid stage of a Spades game. One player asks, “How many books you got?

And then they proceed to run a Boston.', 'Creator/writer Little Marvin is on record suggesting all of this trauma is a win for the culture, that all of the Black people I never got to see in horror films are compensated for in Them by stress-testing a Black nuclear family into physical and psychic annihilation. As a lifelong fan of horror, I have to ask: How many Black people were actually asking to be murdered in horror films, exactly? When Jordan Peele made a similar comment during the marketing for Get Out, he made it clear that while he wondered where all the Black people in horror films were, he wasn’t suggesting he wished we’d die more, and his body of work to date reflects that. His Black characters are tragic figures, but they ascend. They behave like real people, and because they’re Black, they use all of the advice we’ve shouted at movie screens for generations and survive.', 'I need everyone behind the curtain of Them to understand that if I wanted to be traumatized for 10 hours, I already have America to watch.', 'Marvin doesn’t bother striving for such lofty goals. He’s seemingly interested only in Black representation in horror, regardless of the effect or outcome. There is no sense — common or otherwise — in the actions of the protagonists. The family moves into the last neighborhood they should, engages neighbors in ways that would’ve gotten them killed in real life, and even terrorizes one another as the formula requires. In the end, the Black characters behave like White people do in horror films, making Them the Justice Clarence Thomas of horror films.', 'As I scroll my media feeds right now, I am inundated by actual stories of racialized terror, and last week maddeningly so. And when I consider how so many of these stories come to me days or weeks after the killing moment, I’m reminded that some version of this is happening somewhere every day in America: Some Black family is still being run out of their home. Some Black person is driven to despair every day by the unbridled racism in their workplace. Some Black child is being purposefully undereducated by a teacher who sees and seals their fate as a foregone conclusion. Because of this reality, Them feels like the fictionalized sections of a documentary on racism. Here is how bad things used to be, the shows suggest. But who didn’t know that? And why bother making it a period piece in light of the way things are?', 'The effort it takes to get a Black film, television series, or book into the zeitgeist is nearly insurmountable. Because of this, there’s a contingent of Black people who believe that when you have a problem with Black art that makes it through the machine, you should keep any negative criticism to yourself. Kenya Barris confronted this belief head-on in an episode of #blackAF, this idea that to criticize such work makes it harder for all Black art to get out the starting gate, let alone succeed. These admonishments frequently come from people who already work in such industries and who want audiences to know that it’s sometimes a miracle that Black work of any kind gets through. I need people like that to understand that I understand but disagree on the cost–benefit analysis. I want our work to stand up against the best work there is because Black artists create at that level all the time but receive little of the benefit or glory. Frankly, most of what we’re competing against started with us. But I’d be lying if I didn’t admit that I’d rather we spent more time considering what we’re willing to do to make it. I’d rather we consider what aspects of our existence are worth excavating for the purpose of entertainment, Black or otherwise. (I assure you that on a platform as large as Amazon, Black people are not the primary audience consideration.)', 'There’s a reason why the criticism about trauma in Black art keeps coming up: Because it’s real. Representation is a case you can only make for so long before we need to consider the effects of that representation. Black art does not exist in a vacuum. If representation is truly a worthy goal, I should be able to speak on the nature of the representation, as I am its subject. And I need everyone behind the curtain of Them to understand that if I wanted to be traumatized for 10 hours, I already have America to watch.', 'Let me be clear: I don’t want to tell artists what to create. As an artist, I can tell you that the last thing I’d want is someone telling me what to do — it’d almost assuredly have the opposite effect. But we have to be able to talk about when Black art isn’t doing what its creators believe it’s doing, or when the goal isn’t reading the room and may, in fact, be having a deleterious effect. Them is not worth the trauma it causes, and it is not worthy of the pain it mines.']"

These days, once in a while, it’s a black lady — and that’s real progress. But Asians? They’re relegated to the sidelines. Asian men are considered effective castrati — without the masculine qualities to play the stereotypical American hero. And Asian women are a bigger problem entirely. What are they?

It is to explain how American ideals of masculinity are so toxic they are literally fascist.', 'It’s hard, at least for many Americans, to wrap your head around, after all, the idea of “women who aren’t even considered people.” But that is what America teaches its men — it is the epitome and essence of patriarchal violence that women aren’t considered people at all, but a “second caste” as De Beauvoir wrote about.

But most of the attacks seem to be arbitrary: A local UN office estimated that up to 77 percent of people killed in Gaza are civilians.', 'Even worse, there seems to be no limit to who Israelis would kill — the oldest known victim was an 81 year old woman, and the youngest was an 18 month old child. One Palestinian child killed every 3 days by Israel for 13 years.', 'Israel gets away with these crimes against humanity scott free. As Defense for Children International — Palestine (DCIP) points out, “Accountability for shootings [of Palestinian children] by Israeli forces is extremely rare. Only one incident since 2014 has resulted in an indictment.”', 'The group’s accountability program director Ayed Abu Eqtaish stated: “Intentional lethal force now appears to be routinely used by Israeli forces, even in unjustified situations, with no accountability, putting more and more children at risk.”', 'So Palestine cant fight back. They have no military. They are too hungry to sustain long term operations. And the rest of the Middle East is busy dealing with a metric F-ton of other problems. Palestine’s only other option is appealing to the humanity of the rest of the world.', 'So the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement and similar organizations were created to pressure Israel to stop starving and killing Palestinians. They used both traditional and social media and public discourse to get the word out.', 'So far, those pleas have fallen on hard hearts and deaf ears. You might remember when the Governor of New York came out of left field with this announcement:', '“Today, I’m going to sign an Executive Order that says very clearly, we are against the BDS movement, and it’s very simple. If you boycott against Israel, New York will boycott you. If you divert revenues from Israel, New York will divert revenues from you. If you sanction Israel, New York will sanction you, period.” — Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York. 2016', 'Universities long hailed as bastions of free speech have shut down any activism on the part of Palestine.', 'If the world is all about a ‘two-state solution’, why is only one state allowed to speak?', 'I am not asking questions because I am anti-Semetic. The modus operandi of Zionists seem to be to silence critics with baby Hitler labels. I am asking questions because when babies are being killed then everyone should be asking questions.']"

In doing so, The Guardian breached the very editorial freedom the paper was obligated to protect under my contract. I’m speaking out because I believe it is in the public interest to know how a Pulitizer Prize-winning newspaper which styles itself as the world’s leading liberal voice, casually engaged in an act of censorship to shut down coverage of issues that undermined Israel’s publicised rationale for going to war.', 'I joined the Guardian as an environment blogger in April 2013. Prior to this, I had been an author, academic and freelance journalist for over a decade, writing for The Independent, Independent on Sunday, Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, The Scotsman, Foreign Policy, The Atlantic, Quartz, Prospect, New Statesman, Le Monde diplomatique, among others.', 'On 9th July 2014, I posted an article via my Earth Insight blog at The Guardian’s environment website, exposing the role of Palestinian resources, specifically Gaza’s off-shore natural gas reserves, in partly motivating Israel’s invasion of Gaza aka ‘Operation Protective Edge.’ Among the sources I referred to was a policy paper written by incumbent Israeli defence minister Moshe Ya’alon one year before Operation Cast Lead, underscoring that the Palestinians could never be allowed to develop their own energy resources as any revenues would go to supporting Palestinian terrorism.', 'The article now has 68,000 social media shares, and is by far the single most popular article on the Gaza conflict to date. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, Israel has seen control of Gaza’s gas as a major strategic priority over the last decade for three main reasons.', 'Firstly, Israel faces a near-term gas crisis — largely due to the long lead time needed to bring Israel’s considerable domestic gas resources into production; secondly, Netanyahu’s administration cannot stomach any scenario in which a Hamas-run Palestinian administration accesses and develops their own resources; thirdly, Israel wants to use Palestinian gas as a strategic bridge to cement deals with Arab dictatorships whose domestic populations oppose signing deals with Israel.', 'Either way, the biggest obstacle to Israel accessing Gaza’s gas is the Hamas-run administration in the strip, which rejects all previous agreements that Israel had pursued to develop the gas with the British Gas Group and the Palestinian Authority.', 'Since 2006, The Guardian has loudly trumpeted its aim to be the world’s leading liberal voice. For years, the paper has sponsored the annual Index on Censorship’s prestigious Freedom of Expression Award. The paper won the Pulitzer Prize for its reporting on the National Security Agency (NSA). Generally, the newspaper goes out of its way to dress itself up as standing at the forefront of fighting censorship, particularly in the media landscape. This is why its approach to my Gaza gas story is so disturbing.', 'The day after posting it, I received a phone call from James Randerson, assistant national news editor. He sounded riled and rushed. Without beating around the bush, James told me point blank that my Guardian blog was to be immediately discontinued. Not because my article was incorrect, factually flawed, or outrageously defamatory. Not because I’d somehow breached journalistic ethics, or violated my contract. No. The Gaza gas piece, he said, was “not an environment story,” and therefore was an “inappropriate post” for the Guardian’s environment website:', '“You’re writing too many non-environment stories, so I’m afraid we just don’t have any other option. This article doesn’t belong on the environment site. It should really be on Cif [i.e. the Guardian’s online opinion section known as ‘Comment Is Free’].”', 'I was shocked, and more than a little baffled. As you can read on my Guardian profile, my remit was to cover “the geopolitics of environmental, energy and economic crises.” That was what I was commissioned to do — indeed, when I had applied in late 2012 to blog for The Guardian, an earlier piece I’d written on the link between Israeli military operations and Gaza’s gas in Le Monde diplomatique was part of my portfolio.', 'So I suggested to James that termination was somewhat of an overreaction. Perhaps we could simply have a meeting to discuss the editorial issues and work out together what my remit should be. “I’d be happy to cooperate as much as possible,” I said. I didn’t want to lose my contract. James refused point blank, instead telling me that my “interests are increasingly about issues that we don’t think are a good fit for what we want to see published on the environment site.”', 'In the end, my polite protestations got nowhere. Within the hour, I received an email from a rights manager at The Guardian informing me that they had terminated my contract.', 'Under that contract, however, I had editorial control over what I wrote on my blog — obviously within the remit that I had been commissioned for. From May to April, environment bloggers underwent training and supervision to ensure that we would eventually be up to speed to post on the site independently based on our own editorial judgement. The terms and conditions we signed up to under our contract state:', '“You shall regularly maintain Your Blog and shall determine its content. You shall launch Your own posts which shall not be sub-edited by GNM. GNM occasionally might raise topics of interest with You suitable for Your Blog but You shall be under no obligation to include or cover such topics.”', 'The terms also point out that termination of the contract with immediate effect could only occur “if the other party commits a material breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement which is not capable of remedy”; or if “the other party has committed a material breach of any of its obligations under this Agreement which is capable of remedy but which has not been remedied within a period of thirty (30) days following receipt of written notice to do so.”', 'The problem is that I had committed no breach of any of my contractual obligations. On the contrary, The Guardian had breached its contractual obligation to me regarding my freedom to determine the contents of my blog, simply because it didn’t like what I wrote. This is censorship.', 'As the Index on Censorship points out, the “absence of direct state-sponsored, highly visible censorship, which prevails in many countries around the world, may contribute to the commonly held view that there is no censorship in this country and that it is not a problem.” However, “contemporary UK censorship, which sits within a liberal democracy” can come “in many different forms, both direct and indirect, some more subtle, some more overt.”', 'Ironically, a few days later, I was contacted by the editor of The Ecologist — one of the world’s premier environment magazines — who wanted to re-print my Gaza gas story. After publishing an updated version of my Guardian piece, The Ecologist also published my in-depth follow up in response to objections printed in The National Interest (ironically authored by a contractor working for a US oil company invested in offshore gas reserves overlapping the Gaza Marine). Obviously, having been expelled by The Guardian, I could not respond via my blog as I would normally have done.', 'That follow-up drew on a range of public record sources including leading business and financial publications, as well as official British Foreign Office (FCO) documents obtained under Freedom of Information. The latter confirmed that despite massive domestic gas discoveries in Israel’s own territorial waters, the inability to kick-start production due to a host of bureaucratic, technological, logistical and regulatory issues — not to mention real uncertainties in quantities of commercially exploitable resources — meant that Israel could face gas supply challenges as early as next year. Israel’s own gas fields would probably not be brought into production until around 2018-2020. Israeli officials, according to the FCO, saw the 1.4 trillion cubic meters of gas in Gaza’s Marine (along with other potential “additional resources” as yet to be discovered according to the US Energy Information Administration) as a cheap “stop-gap” that might sustain both Israel’s domestic energy needs and its export ambitions until the Tamar and Leviathan fields could actually start producing.', 'By broaching such issues in The Guardian, though, it seems I had crossed some sort of invisible barrier — that this topic was simply off-limits.', 'To illustrate the sheer absurdity of The Guardian’s pretense that a story about Gaza’s gas resources is “not a legitimate environment story,” consider the fact that just weeks earlier, Adam Vaughan, the editor of the Guardian’s environment website, had personally assented to my posting the following story: ‘Iraq blowback: Isis rise manufactured by insatiable oil addiction — West’s co-optation of Gulf states’ jihadists created the neocon’s best friend: an Islamist Frankenstein.’', 'Proposed headlines for stories that environment bloggers work on are posted on a shared Google spreadsheet so that editors can keep track of what we’re doing and planning to publish. Adam had seen my proposed headline and requested to see the draft on the 16th June: “… would you mind sending this one by me on preview, please, before publishing? Just conscious it’s very sensitive subject,” he wrote in an email.', 'I sent him the full article with a summary of what it was about. Later in the day, I pinged him again to find out what he thought, and he replied: “thanks, sorry, yes — I think it’s fine.”', 'So an article about ISIS and oil addiction is “fine,” but a piece about Israel, Gaza and conflict over gas resources is not. Really? Are offshore gas resources not part of the environment? Apparently, for The Guardian, not in Palestine, where Gaza’s environment has been bombed to smithereens by the IDF.', 'Meanwhile, the Israel-Gaza gas saga continues. Just over a week ago, Ha’aretz carried some insightful updates on the strategic value of the whole thing. Quoting Ariel Ezrahi, energy adviser to Quartet Middle East envoy Tony Blair (the Quartet representing the US, UN, EU and Russia), Ha’aretz noted that there was a reason why Jordan — which had recently signed an agreement with Israel to purchase gas from its Leviathan field — had simultaneously announced that it intended to purchase gas from Gaza. As Israel attempts to reposition itself as a major gas exporter to regional regimes like Egypt and Turkey, the biggest challenge is that “it’s very hard for them to sign a gas contract with Israel despite their desperate need,” due to how unpopular such a move would be with their domestic populations.', '“If I were Israel’s prime minister,” Blair’s energy adviser said, “I’d think how I could help the neighboring countries extricate themselves from the jam, and if Israel closes the Palestinian gas market, that’s not a smart thing.” So Israel has to find a way to open the Palestinian gas market and integrate it into the emerging complex of Israeli export deals: “… it would be wise for Israel to at least consider the contribution of the Palestinian dimension to these deals,” said Ezrahi. “I think it’s a mistake for Israel to rush into regional agreements without at least considering the Palestinian dimension and how it can contribute to Israeli interests.”', 'Israel, backed by its allies in the west, wants to use the Palestinians “as an asset as they strive to join the regional power grid, and as a bridge to the Arab world,” by selling Palestinian “gas to various markets,” or promoting a deal with the corporations developing Israel’s “Tamar and Leviathan [fields] that will allow for the sale of cheap gas to the [Palestinian] Authority.”', 'But there is a further challenge when considering the Palestinian dimension, namely Hamas: “I can’t meet with people linked to Hamas,” said Blair’s energy adviser. “It’s a very firm ban dictated by the Quartet. [emphasis added] The Americans don’t enter Gaza either.” So it is not just Israel that has ruled out any gas deal with the Palestinians involving Hamas. So have the US, EU, UN and Russia.', 'But Israel has no mechanism to eliminate Hamas from the Gaza strip — except, as far as Moshe Ya’alon is concerned, military action to change facts on the ground.', 'Over the 70 odd articles I’d written for The Guardian, not a single piece falls outside the subject matter I had been commissioned to write on: the geopolitics of interconnected environment, energy and economic crises. The conclusion is unavoidable: The Guardian had simply decided that resource conflicts over the Occupied Territories should not receive coverage. It should be noted that before my post, the paper had never before acknowledged a link between IDF military action and Gaza’s gas. Now that I’m gone, I doubt it will ever be covered again.', 'Well, at least Ya’alon, and his boss Netanyahu, will be happy.', 'Not to mention Tony Blair.', 'When I began speaking in confidence to a number of other journalists inside and outside The Guardian about what had happened to me, they all consistently told me that my experience — although particularly outrageous — was not entirely unprecedented.', 'A senior editor of a national British publication who has written frequently for The Guardian’s opinion section, told me that he was aware that all coverage of the Israel-Palestine issue was “tightly controlled” by Jonathan Freedland, the Guardian’s executive editor for opinion.', 'Another journalist told me that a Guardian editor commissioned a story from him discussing the suppression of criticism of Israel in public discourse and media, but that Freedland rejected the story without even reviewing a draft.', 'Several other journalists I spoke to inside and outside The Guardian went so far as to describe Freedland as the newspaper’s unofficial ‘gatekeeper’ on the Middle east conflict, and that he invariably leaned toward a pro-Israel slant.', 'These anecdotes have been publicly corroborated by Jonathan Cook, a former Middle East staff reporter, foreign editor and columnist for The Guardian, who is currently based in Nazareth where he has won several awards for his reporting. A profile of Cook at the progressive Jewish news site Mondoweiss points out that a key turning point in Cook’s career occurred in 2001 when he had just returned from Israel, having conducted an investigation into the murder of 13 non-violent Arab protestors by Israeli police during the second intifada the year before.', 'The police, Cook found, had executed a “shoot-to-kill policy” against unarmed victims — as was eventually confirmed by a government inquiry. But The Guardian suppressed his investigation, and chose not to run it at all. Cook says that while the paper does contain some exemplary reporting and insights, and even goes out of its way to condemn the occupation, there are certain lines that simply cannot be crossed, such as questioning Israel’s capacity to define itself as simultaneously an exclusively Jewish and democratic state, or critiquing aspects of its security doctrine.', 'Cook’s scathing criticism of his former paper in a 2011 Counterpunch article is highly revealing, and relevant, for understanding what happened to me:', '“The Guardian, like other mainstream media, is heavily invested — both financially and ideologically — in supporting the current global order. It was once able to exclude and now, in the internet age, must vilify those elements of the left whose ideas risk questioning a system of corporate power and control of which the Guardian is a key institution.', 'The paper’s role, like that of its rightwing cousins, is to limit the imaginative horizons of readers. While there is just enough leftwing debate to make readers believe their paper is pluralistic, the kind of radical perspectives needed to question the very foundations on which the system of Western dominance rests is either unavailable or is ridiculed.”', 'Last month, Cook highlighted ongoing subtle but powerful insensitivities of language employed by The Guardian coverage’s of the Gaza crisis which, in effect, served to “disappear” the Palestinians. He specifically identified Freedland as a major player in this phenomenon. “The Guardian’s pride” in having helped create Israel is “still palpable at the paper (as I know from my years there),” especially among certain senior editors there “who influence much of the conflict’s coverage — yes, that is a reference to Jonathan Freedland, among others.”', '===', 'UPDATE 4th Dec 2014 (10.13AM): Jonathan Freedland has offered a response this morning via TwitLonger, as follows:', '“Your piece for Medium implies I was involved in the end of your arrangement with the Guardian. I don’t wish to be rude, but I had literally not heard of you or your work till seeing that Medium piece, via Twitter, a few hours ago. (The Guardian environment website, where you wrote, is edited separately from the Guardian’s Comment is Free site, which I now oversee.) I had no idea you wrote for the Guardian, no idea that arrangement had been terminated and not the slightest knowledge of your piece on Gaza’s gas until a few hours ago. What’s more, I was abroad — on vacation — on the days in July you describe. To put it starkly, my involvement in your case was precisely zero. I hope that as a matter of your own journalistic integrity, you’ll want to alter the Medium piece to reflect these facts. Perhaps you’ll also share this on Twitter as widely as you shared the Medium piece yesterday.”', 'However, Freedland’s reading of this piece is incorrect. I am not implying that Freedland was “involved” in the end of my Guardian tenure. I have no clue about that, and to be sure, I did not make any such claim above.', 'My simple point is that my experience of egregious Guardian censorship over the Gaza gas story — which Freedland does not address beyond denying his involvement — has a long and little-known context, suggesting that rather than my experience being a mere bizarre and accidental aberration, it is part of an entrenched, wider culture across the paper of which Freedland himself has allegedly played a key role in fostering.', 'It is not my fault that the range of journalists I spoke to all described Freedland as the Guardian’s resident unofficial “gatekeeper” on Israel-Palestine coverage. Notably, Freedland fails to address their allegations that he has previously quashed stories which are critical of Israel on ideological grounds rather than reasons of ‘journalistic integrity.’', 'END', '===', 'This is perhaps not entirely surprising. A book commissioned by The Guardian, Disenchantment: The Guardian and Israel, by Daphna Baram, documents clearly the connection between the newspaper and Zionism, noting for instance that Guardian editor CP Scott had been central to the negotiations with the British government resulting in the Balfour Declaration and the very conception of the state of Israel. Her conclusion is that despite becoming increasingly critical of the occupation after 1967, The Guardian remains staunchly pro-Zionist, its staff devoting “inordinate time and effort” to ensure “fairness to Israel.”', 'The Guardian, quite rightly, has a reputation for breaking some of the most important news stories of the decade — among them, of course, playing a lead role in releasing Edward Snowden’s revelations about mass surveillance and related violations of civil liberties. Yet hidden in the cracks of this coverage is the fact that while disclosing critical facts, The Guardian has been unable to raise the most fundamental and probing questions about the purpose and direction of mass surveillance, why it has accelerated, what motivates it, and who benefits from it.', 'Questions must therefore be asked as to why a newspaper that sees itself as the global media’s bastion of liberalism, has engaged in such grievous censorship by shutting down coverage of environmental geopolitics — a phenomenon which is increasingly at the heart not just of conflict over the Occupied Territories, but of the chaos of world affairs in the 21st century.', 'If this is the state of The Guardian, undoubtedly one of the better newspapers, then clearly we have a serious problem with the media. Ultimately, mainstream media remains under the undue influence of powerful special interests, whether financial, corporate or ideological.', 'Given the scale of the converging crises we face in terms of climate change, energy volatility, financial crisis, rampant inequality, proliferating species extinctions, insane ocean acidification, food crisis, foreign policy militarism, and the rise of the police-state — and given the bankruptcy of much of the media in illuminating the real causes of these crises and their potential solutions, we need new reliable and accountable sources of news and information.', 'We need new media, and we need it now.', 'As print newspapers go increasingly into decline, the opportunity for new people-powered models of independent digital media is rising exponentially. That’s why I’ve launched a crowdfunder to help support my journalism, and to move toward creating a new investigative journalism collective that operates in the public interest, precisely because it is funded not by corporations or ideologues, but by people. If we can create new journalism platforms that are dependent for their survival on citizens themselves, then it is in the interests of citizens that those platforms will function. Until then, fearless, adversarial investigative journalism will always be in danger of being shut down or compromised.', 'I believe that together, we can create a new people-powered model of journalism that will make the old, hierarchical media conglomerates dominated by special interests and parochial paternalistic visions of the world obsolete.

The powers we gravitate towards are not their voices, their talent playing instruments or their composition of music, but their deep, natural sense of empathy.', 'This weekend, in response to news that Lana Del Rey will be the biggest star performing at Israel’s Meteor Festival, young fans from around the world, including Palestinians, began to urge the American artist to skip the concert using the hashtag #LanaDontGo. Fans cited the increasingly influential movement to boycott Israel into accountability for human rights violations and the brand new nation-state law that enshrines its long and rapidly increasing and unapologetic actions. These actions resemble South African Apartheid and the Jim Crow south, both of which were ended using boycotts.', 'The demand reached its peak Sunday, after Lana tweeted about former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani’s claiming that “the truth isn’t the truth” when questioned about investigation of his client, Donald Trump. What was expected to be the usual support young fans show artists when they call out Trump, turned instead into an opportunity to address the actual truths of state violence against Palestinians in West Bank only 8 minutes away from the concert and seconds from Palestinians, other Arabs, Druze and Africans all through Tel Aviv.', 'In response to the blowback, Lana crafted a statement about her decision to play Israel.', 'Her full statement is below with my comments.', '“On the topic of ‘truth’ (my earlier tweet that references a statement made by Giuliani about Trump today) I understand many of u are upset that we’re going to Tel Aviv for the Meteor festival, I understand your concern I really get do.”', 'Lana here introduces “we” rather than “I”, helping to diffuse her influence and responsibility for the decisions she makes. I’m sure many people are involved, but I’m also sure Lana Del Rey has enough agency with Lana Del Rey to follow her lead.', '“What I can tell you is I believe music is universal and should be used to brings us together. We signed on the show w the intention that it would be performed for the kids there and my plan was for it to be done w loving energy w a thematic emphasis on peace.”', 'Specifically, Israeli kids. Palestinian kids caged into West Bank and Gaza will not be allowed to attend. Kids in Gaza and West Bank, who are nearly 50% of the population, are banned from travel. And 273 Palestinian children as young as 14 are held in Israeli prison. There is nothing about this event that is “universal” or “brings us together”. It is akin to walking passed the black section to the white section of a cafeteria to sing songs about unity.', '“If you don’t agree with it I get it. I see both sides.”', 'Here is where Lana’s statement begins to verge on Giuliani’s statement about truth. There aren’t two sides to human rights. There is only one absolute truth.', '“But me and my band have been performing all over the world for month out of the years for close to 10 years now together. And we’re about to travel to a place that many big bands are playing this and at this festival.”', 'Again we have an example of diffusing responsibility. Lana isn’t just another act on a long list of artists, she is the biggest selling, most successful artist on the ticket with enormous power.', '“We don’t always agree with the politics of the places we play within or even in our own country- sometimes we don’t even feel safe, depending on how far abroad but we travel- but we are musicians and we’ve dedicated our lives to being on the road.”', 'Politics are how much we should pay in taxes. If college should be debt free. Human rights are not politics and pegging it to “we don’t always agree on politics” doesn’t add up. You may disagree on the politics of a 5 cent refund on the plastic bottle that holds water, but one wouldn’t put “we don’t always agree on politics” before a super power denying a besieged community access to drinking water — which Israel does as collective punishment and to literally fill pools and garden sprinklers of illegal settlements.', '“So in closing although I have deep sentiments over what is true or not true, right or wrong- I would like to remind you that performing in Tel Aviv is not a political statement or a commitment to the politics there”', 'Lana here claims deep sentiments but has yet to even introduce the word “Palestinian” in her statement. In fact, her entire statement does not mention Palestinians at all. That is political.', '“just as singing here in California doesn’t mean my views are in alignment w my current governments opinions or sometimes inhuman actions.”', 'This is comparing apples to hummus.', 'Had San Diego defied the US Constitution and installed walls around people of Latinx background, starving them of medical supplies, school supplies and their own fishing and drinking waters while occasionally bombing peaceful protests, assassinating unarmed nurses, and imprisoning poets for poetry, Lana Del Ray would not be playing San Diego.', '“Or that I condone my own president who openly mocked disabled people at rallies (I’m not in anyway likening the gravity of certain travesties that have occured in Israel to the current hardships we’re facing here)”', 'It’s very strange here that when you even attempt to mention Palestinians, you say Israel.', '“I’m just stating that I’m a simple singer,”', 'Singers have spent generations and risked great harm to their lives and the lives of their families to protest.

It simply reflects modern terminology and encompasses historic events to which the Zionist mind is still largely closed.', 'These historic events are simple in their broad outline. Zionist Jews (self-proclaimed atheists) decided to build a Jewish state in Palestine and ended up taking much of the land by force and expelling the majority of the Palestinian non-Jewish Arab population, preventing them from returning. Now Israel is occupying the rest of the territory the World Zionist Organization didn’t manage to take and continues to “settle” it.', 'In The Ends of Zionism: Racism and the Palestinian Struggle, Joseph Massad writes:', 'Zionism as a colonial movement is constituted in ideology and practice by a religio-racial epistemology through which it apprehends itself and the world around it… It is no longer contested, even among many Israelis, that the impact of Zionism on the Palestinian people in the last one hundred years includes: the expulsion of a majority of Palestinians from their lands and homes, the prevention of their return, and the subsequent confiscation of their property for the exclusive use of Jews; imposing a military apartheid system on those Palestinians who remained in Israel from 1948 until 1966, which since then has been relaxed to a civilian Jewish supremacist system of discrimination; and the military occupation and apartheid system imposed on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and their population for the last thirty-five years [now fifty years] as well as continued colonization of these occupied territories.', 'In that sense, the history of Jewish European settler-colonialism — i.e., Zionism — behind Palestine and Israel (as opposed to history as Zionist “narrative” or myth) has the voice of reason behind it, because it reveals an atrocity that must be redressed.', 'Acknowledging and taking accountability for Israel’s historic and ongoing crimes against Palestinian Arabs is the first step in resolving the Nakba. The historic details regarding why and how these tragic events happened have filled many books, but they are beside the point.', 'The broad outline by itself has the voice of reason if you also consider justice as reasonable and injustice as unreasonable.', 'What is reasonable or plausible, for example, about Ivanka Kushner now being able to buy a house in Jerusalem and “return” to Israel by dint of her conversion to Judaism and her American husband’s Jewishness, but Ghada Karmi, a Muslim Palestinian Arab being denied return to her homeland and not even allowed to buy back her own father’s stolen house?', 'In Humanizing the Text: Israeli “New History” and the Trajectory of the 1948 Historiography, Ilan Pappe, who is famously known for his The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine, writes:', 'One thing is clear when analyzing the fortunes of Israeli new history from the time of its inception in the late 1980s until its brief/temporary disappearance in 2000: historical reconstruction is closely linked to general political developments and upheavals. In societies torn by internal and external rifts and conflicts, the work of historians is constantly pervaded by the political drama around them. In such geopolitical locations the pretense of objectivity is particularly misplaced, if not totally unfounded.', 'Radical Jewish dissident historians like Ilan Pappe in Israel are vital to a history that has the voice of reason on its side. They are a bridge to a wider public in Israel.', 'Palestinians often wonder what it takes to break through to the consciousness of Western publics with regard to the 70-year-long tragic history of Palestine.', 'I believe that the best way of shifting Western publics’ opinion from supporting Israel to supporting the Palestinian cause is to continue emphasizing what has already taken place through the demise of the so-called “peace process” and “two-state solution” — the realization, so long obscured, that the problem of Israel lies in its nature as a Zionist settler-colonial project in Palestine, rather than as a military “occupier”.', 'In Why the term ‘Israeli occupation’ must be rejected, Ramzy Baroud writes,', '…It is often argued that Israel is an occupier that has violated the rules of occupation as stated in international law. This would have been the case a year, two years or five years after the original occupation had taken place, but not 51 years later. Since then, the occupation has turned into long-term colonization.', 'Many people believe that the Great March of Return has had so much positive journalistic reactions in Western media because the protest is essentially non-violent — i.e., it cannot be said to threaten Israel’s security and so the deadly force Israel uses is “disproportionate” and criminal.', 'That’s as far as Palestinian non-violent action goes. It doesn’t do anything to change Western publics’ perceptions of Israel as a legitimate Western-like state protecting its “borders” (albeit with disproportionate force) against a sea of Arabs or their perceptions of Palestinians as “rioters” and “barbarians” whose sole evil wish is to kill Jews.', 'Non-violent resistance has its uses, certainly, but it must never be pushed on an oppressed and brutalized people, in my view, as a higher moral ground of resistance.', 'Additionally, the emphasis on the tactic of non-violent resistance implicitly delegitimizes other forms of resistance, making saints out of some Palestinian martyrs and hunger-striking prisoners held under administrative detention (i.e., those imprisoned without charge) and accepting Israel’s justification for the execution and imprisonment of thousands of other Palestinians.  What’s different about the Great March of Return is that its demand of return connects the “occupation” and siege with the Nakba, dramatizing for a Western audience, through protest and resistance, the colonization of all of Palestine.', 'That demand, heard for the first time in the recent history of Palestinian resistance, is shifting the perceptions of Western publics.', 'Activists for justice in Palestine on social media have long used different tactics (primarily documenting and publicizing Israel’s violations of international law and human decency) to reach Western publics (to break through mainstream media in the West). The most effective are the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI) campaigns that persuade academic big names and cultural and sports celebrities to take up the Palestinian cause.', 'Western publics are also becoming more aware of the Zionist backlash against The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaigns, especially as they impinge on freedom of speech.', 'Generally, addressing Western audiences, especially those on the Left, works by reference to progressive values applicable to injustices against all marginalized groups in Western society, as it brings home the incongruity of singling the Palestinian cause as an exception.', 'Western audiences are assumed to be part of the Judeo-Christian tradition, a term coined by George Orwell in the late 1930s in order to fight anti-Semitism. Unfortunately, this humanist tradition is tainted, because anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism are now linked inexorably within it, and so combating one means combating the other.   Western civilization has long been defined by colonial conquest (with Islamophobia and Arabophobia in the Middle East) and imperial power; it is what gave birth to Zionism. Furthermore,', '… once established in its position of military superiority, the colonial culture produces, through a whole range of media, an unending ‘series of propositions that slowly and subtly — with the help of books, newspapers, schools and their texts, advertisements, films, radio — work their way into one’s mind and shape one’s view of the world of the group to which one belongs’… Successful colonisation leads the oppressed to identify with the world view of the oppressor.', 'The Palestinian Authority now identifies with its oppressor so thoroughly that it did not shy away, as dictated by Israel, from cracking down viciously on Palestinians in the West Bank rallying against Mahmoud Abbas’s punitive economic measures in Gaza.', 'What will ultimately change Western Public’s perceptions are Palestinians themselves, however they choose to resist.

And so, as I begin teaching my boys survival basics like riding a bike, waiting in line, and… yes… crossing the street, I’ll work hard to avoid phrases like “little White man.” Obviously “bright light person” rolls off the tongue far less mellifluously, but a bit of extra verbal labor is worth the price of not conceding our power to even one more little White man.']"

Nay Aug Park was a bustling amusement complex in the mid 1900s, complete with a carousel and a small wooden roller coaster. But during our date in 1997 the park was very different. Owners shut most of it down by then, and the city used it for events instead.', 'I remember walking around the festival with Chris, ordering deep-fried food like pizza fritta from the local Italian vendors, or the haluski soaked with butter from the Polish families who operated restaurants just a few miles away. Chris and I sat on the picnic bench, tapping our feet to the sounds of the live music we’d rarely get to see, not being old enough to enter any bars.', 'I’d scribble his name in my school notebooks for two years — this was bonafide puppy love. That night, we even held hands. It was a magical date and a happy burst of teenage hormones until he dropped me off at home for my 11 o’clock curfew.', 'I was lucky enough to have the type of amazing mom who waited up for her teenager to get home.

The unknown caller said they recognized me at the park “holding hands with a black guy” and wanted to make sure she was aware.', 'In 1997 (and of course very long before that), this type of racist behavior was pretty common in cities across America. Sadly, twenty years later, it still is.', 'Born and raised in a town known for being the home of NBC’s comedy “The Office”, the scrappy city where former Vice President Joe Biden gets his BFD grit, or the popular final stop for presidential candidates in the swing state of Pa., the city of Scranton has made its way into popular and political culture across America.', 'Anyone who knows me would say I wear my blue-collar roots as a badge of honor. This very white, working-class town and my big Irish family taught me a whole lot.

It’s not on the handful of minority employees to create and execute a diversity plan. It’s on the white people at every level across the company to take responsibility for creating a workplace of diverse people and views and for recognizing what a better company you will be for it.', 'Let’s get proximate. I spent this week polling a number of family members, asking some how they ended up so open-minded growing up in our environment and asking others if they think it’s possible to change. Those exchanges gave me more hope this past week than anything I’ve read online.', 'Some attributed their appreciation for diversity to their proximity to non-white members of the family or friends, others pointed to “honest” history books, church teachings, travel to other cities, joining diverse athletic teams and school clubs, and one even said it was the women of the family who truly helped reshape their views more than others.', 'And when I posed the question to other members of the family who I suspected weren’t following this week’s events and maybe didn’t care, they proved me wrong. One challenged my assumption and even pointed out how different things are since I left Scranton twenty years ago. He said while we may have been exposed to a lot of racism growing up, our generation is maturing and forming new opinions and beliefs of our own. He also smartly noted that every family and individual is going to have to address racism differently.

It wasn’t far from where the singer and the Genesis band drummer Phil Collins lived.', 'The farmhouse was rustic and spacious, with a cozy feel to it. There were numerous hiking trails in the vicinity, and I could already see myself rolling in the hay and living the exciting outdoor life I had always craved. We moved in during my first trimester as I looked forward to a fit pregnancy full of lots of fresh air and walks in the Swiss countryside. I was completely unprepared for how things would turn out.', 'I should have noticed that despite our house being in the center of the village, surrounded by many other dwellings, no one acknowledged our presence or came out to say “hello” when we arrived. There were passerby’s for sure, but whenever I tried to make eye contact, they looked away. I put it all up to the fact that we were new and that they needed time to adjust. After a month of being systemically avoided and ignored, I began to realize that there was something wrong.', 'One evening, my husband and I decided to grab a pizza at the local pizzeria. We figured it would be an opportunity to meet some of our neighbors and eventually make some friends. We entered the noisy restaurant and the entire room fell silent as everyone interrupted whatever they were doing to stare at us. Some seemed surprised and even shocked to see us.

Clearly, the people in the village disliked us. We were new, and maybe they didn’t like strangers, but what I had witnessed during those few minutes in the pizzeria, was their hatred. It was the type steeped only in deep racism and hatred of blackness.', 'We had only lived there for a month and weren’t ready to move out just so soon so we decided to stick it out. We decided that we would try and win over the villagers. For months, we tried to socialize with the community: we engaged with the mailman when he came around, we attempted to speak to our neighbors, the shopkeepers, and the farmers in the fields but we were ignored or made to feel unwelcome whenever we did. It was a very lonely time for us.', 'One morning, I saw a lady pushing a pram walk by the house. She was young and I imagined she may be more open-minded than the others.

It was a lot more international there and the hospital staff was kind. I secretly hoped that when we returned to our village with the baby, people would be curious or more accepting of us. I realize now that that was too much to ask.', ""Once back home with our son, I took every opportunity to take him on long walks. The motion usually made him fall asleep quite fast.

We moved back to the diverse, multicultural environment we knew, the place that had always accepted us."", 'Often, my white friends who live in the countryside ask why we live a stone’s throw away from the city.

It has caused me too much pain and suffering.', 'And you might argue with that and say: “Yes, I can choose to live anywhere I want, but the reality is can I really? Can I? ”', 'Some places make you feel so unwelcome that it’s not worth the emotional strife and discomfort. So while I too sometimes fool myself by saying, I am free, the reality is that I’m not really that free.

They should be colorblind, we insist, merely admitting or hiring the most qualified! And more to the point, we proclaim, targeting folks of color for opportunities means discrimination against us, making us the victims of horrific reverse racism.', 'So, yes, it remains the case that even when black folks have college degrees they’re nearly twice as likely as comparable whites to be out of work; and Latinos with degrees are about 50 percent more likely than comparable whites to be out of work. And yes, even whites who claim to have criminal records are more likely to be hired than equally qualified blacks without records, but still, can anti-white lynchings be far behind?', 'And yes, blacks and Latinos combined only represent about 13 percent of students at the most selective colleges and universities — the only ones that actually practice any kind of real affirmative action for admissions — and there are twice as many whites admitted to elite schools with less-than-average qualifications as there are people of color so admitted, but still, can any rational person doubt that whites will soon be limited to mere token representation at the nation’s best educational institutions?', 'That such hand-wringing about so-called reverse discrimination reeks of intellectual mendacity should be obvious by now. Despite years of so-called reverse racism, whites remain atop every indicator of social and economic well-being when compared to the African Americans and Latinx folks who, it is claimed, are displacing us from our perch. Whether looking at employment data, income, or net worth, we are the ones in better shape without exception.', 'Indeed, in some regards the gaps between whites and folks of color have grown in recent years, as with wealth gaps, which have actually quadrupled since the 1980s, now leaving the typical white family with over 20 times the net worth of the typical black family and 18 times that of the typical Latinx family. Even when comparing families of middle-class income and occupational status, whites possess 3–5 times the net worth of middle class blacks, suggesting that even African Americans who have procured good careers and obtained college degrees lag well behind their white counterparts, due in large measure to the inherited disadvantages of past generations, affirmative action notwithstanding.', 'Ulitmately, claiming that affirmative action not only disproves white privilege, but indeed suggests its opposite — black and brown privilege — as many have argued to me via email exchanges, ignores the entire social context within which affirmative action occurs.', 'It’s like protesting that sick people are privileged, relative to the healthy, because there are no hospitals for the latter.', 'It’s like complaining that the poor are privileged relative to the well-off, because no one sets up soup kitchens to serve the affluent; nor does Habitat for Humanity ever show up to build mansions for the rich.', 'It’s like insisting that the disabled are privileged because they get bigger bathroom stalls, or because of all those special parking spaces, and that the able-bodied are oppressed because we have to walk a bit further when we go shopping at the mall or for groceries.', 'It’s like complaining that women are privileged and men oppressed because hospitals don’t have paternity wards.', 'It’s like whining about how the LGBT community is privileged and we straight and cisgendered folks oppressed, since, after all, “the gays” have their own parades and bars that cater to their needs. Where’s our parade? Where’s our bar?', 'It’s like inveighing against the privileges enjoyed by Jews or Muslims, what with that Kosher or Halal certification you can find on grocery items nowadays. Obviously, going out of the way to make sure observant Jews and Muslims know what food is OK for them to eat is nothing less than naked favoritism! After all, where’s the little Jesus cross to let Christians know what food is holy for them?', 'It’s like rich people, who make millions or even billions (and as such, likely pay a pretty hefty tax bill annually) complaining about how working class folks who earn only $15,000 or so not only don’t pay income taxes, they actually get a refund in the form of the Earned Income Tax Credit! As such, it’s obvious that the working poor are the truly advantaged in society! And this is especially true when you think about all the thrift shops and discount stores that are established to serve them, and those check-cashing outlets and pawn shops!

Where’s our government cheese?', 'For that matter, one might ask where’s our National Association for the Advancement of White People?

Which is to say, it’s the kind of thing that can only make sense to those lacking the most basic capacity for critical thought, and anything remotely resembling that which we might call, perspective.', 'Such is the face of white privilege in the twenty-first century: a systematized reality so normalized and taken for granted by the majority of whites, that any deviation from its totalizing script becomes cause for alarm in the eyes of millions.', 'That such a weak, hypersensitive and over-indulged group as this should wield such power would be funny were it not so dangerous.', '_______', 'I tweet and Facebook.

After I wrote this essay to the group, I had a conversation with prominent trauma studies specialist Jack Saul who said that journalists denied the chance to tell the truth by their newsrooms found it as damaging or more so than the effects of witnessing violence, war, or disaster.', 'It was a massive aha moment for me. Being denied the chance to tell the truth and help the world by doing so is a betrayal of the very premise of our profession, one I have felt acutely. At times, I have questioned whether my years as a journalist were wasted, since the act of telling the truth did not prevent this painful moment in history or measurably change the newsrooms I tried to de-bias. But I am just one runner in a long relay race towards justice, and I have to accept with humility that I cannot determine the outcomes, only my own actions.', 'Having covered the past six elections, I now find myself on the cusp of adding my voice to 2020 coverage as well.

Others — including many of those who control what makes the news — live lives of privilege at the back of the train, and maybe didn’t feel anything at first when others were impacted. But I’d say for damned sure that everyone knows we’re off the rails as a nation now.', 'The economic disenfranchisement of Black people and other people of color is not limited in any way to poor or working class folks. I have dealt with extreme amounts of race and gender discrimination within journalism. Incidents included having a grant made to my Black-interest show at NPR stolen by another team’s white co-workers. No, I am not exaggerating, and yes I have proof. Later I was harassed by my white co-host on WNYC’s The Takeaway. CEO Laura Walker let him create a hostile work environment for three female cohosts of African descent, and sexually harass Asian women. Nonetheless, he was protected and made twice as much as us female cohosts. We lost income and, in my case, probably my last chance to have a biological child. I told Laura about the harassment directly to her face, and she did nothing, so she can’t pretend ignorance. Yet this month, she became a college president!', 'This is a total #FAIL of meritocracy, decency, and intersectional feminism. No Black woman could survive a documented history of allowing a man to harass a string of white women and then be elevated to college president. But Walker gets to be the moral leader that young women of color, and men and women of every race, rely on to tell them what it means to be a productive and moral citizen in the world. And Walker is far less qualified, with no terminal degree, than many Black and POC candidates for her job. White colleagues protected her, and white privilege protects her to this day. It’s an outrage. In other words, it’s just another day being Black.', 'I’m gratified to be launching a new radio show next month, Our Body Politic, centering women of color in politics. But it is not an exaggeration to say that I was robbed of years of doing my chosen work at the level of excellence at which I operate, with sufficient resources. Today, I help other journalists and storytellers find financial and production resources.', 'So, getting paid what I’m worth and being treated with respect in my industry has been a nightmare. If you read in on media news, you’ll see the entire public radio system, and many other media outlets, are being wracked by the racial equivalent of #MeToo. Not only were we journalists of color robbed of opportunity, the nation was harmed by our exile and marginalization. I dare say if you ask any Black reporter about the 2016 election, we knew Donald Trump was a serious contender WAY before our white colleagues realized that. (And some didn’t realize it until election night!)', 'At FiveThirtyEight, I was prevented from reporting on the impact of racial animus on politics for months, because Nate Silver thought I was, in his words, “cherry picking the facts.” I was just doing my job and matching historical patterns, including the career of Arizona’s Sheriff Joe Arpaio, to the 2016 race. It took Nate months to announce that he had come around to recognizing the (obvious) pattern of Trump’s viability and reliance on racial resentment. I am still sad about all the stories I was not allowed to tell because a white supervisor believed I was motivated by racial score settling and not telling the truth. Nate and I have talked about it recently, but I’m still not sure he takes responsibility for suppressing work I could have added to our collective knowledge.', 'I call what I went through the Black Cassandra complex. Black women often see the future, because we have to hone our pattern recognition skills to survive, and we have to imagine a better future to carry on. But when we sound the alarm, no one listens to us. In fact, we get penalized for speaking uncomfortable truths. As one friend of mine who is a black female tech investor said, “I wish it didn’t cost us to tell the truth.”', 'Let me tell you one story about telling the truth with integrity. In 2016, I was verbally sexually harassed by a Trump voter I interviewed in Eastern Ohio. I could have put it in my story. But I believe it would have prejudiced readers rather than enlighten them. I could have gotten a ton of buzz for talking about my own sadness, anger, and shame at having been verbally violated. But that’s not what I was there to cover. I put the story before my story. I believed and still believe leaving that incident out was the right choice, and that writing about it later in a separate article was the right choice too.', 'So — remaining true to my calling and earning money has been hard. It’s also been hard to hold on to money. During my life, I have helped members of my extended family, including at one point my father. My dad was brilliant and principled, and dealt with mental illness later in life. He quit his job as the first post-independence news director of the Zimbabwean Broadcasting Corporation because Robert Mugabe was forcing him to add propaganda to the news. He was blacklisted and died in relative poverty. So, discrimination made me earn less than my colleagues; and I also paid what South Africans call “The Black Tax” in aiding family in Zimbabwe and the US.', 'People who champion capitalism have some hard choices to make — choices just as hard as the ones facing democracy. American capitalism is just one variation on a theme. In many other capitalist nations, people of varied income share both the prosperity and the pain of progress better. Their capitalism is less callous, less cruel, and less unequal. Our version of capitalism grew from the bloody soil of slavery — which Senator Tom Cotton recently called a “necessary evil” — and from the land theft from Indigenous tribes. Please check out the Supreme Court case United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians to learn more about just one case that is pivotal to understanding the scale of theft. In other words, “Blood on the leaves and blood at the root” is as much a part of the story of US capitalism as innovation and industry. And although we Black folk are certainly better off than in slavery, we are bound by an intergenerational system of labor discrimination and financial industry bias.', 'Capitalism is regional in execution. For example, German capitalism, while not perfect, is far more sophisticated and compassionate than American capitalism in many ways, including support for working parents. Of course, we’re the only developed country which doesn’t mandate paid parental leave, and which has little support for childcare. Germany also kicked our ass on an economic strategy re: the pandemic. (See: Kurzarbeit). So we have capitalism, and so does Germany. But here people die as “externalities” to our particular brand of capitalism far too often, in brutal numbers. (See: Purdue Pharma.)', 'American capitalism is a particular mix of capitalism, kleptocracy and oligarchy, and arguably becoming more of the latter two over time. Nonetheless, I believe that Black Americans should access the wealth and opportunity of this nation. We do the work, and have done it forever. We built the White House and the Capitol for no pay, i.e. slavery, back in the days where we were counted as 3/5ths of a human being. Today, Black women get 62 cents to the dollar that white men make. That’s not half a loaf… but it’s 3/5ths of a loaf, right?', 'One example of what’s so profoundly wrong with our system comes through analyses of the PPP loan process. The National Community Reinvestment Coalition sent Black and white testers to banks to talk about securing PPP loans for their small businesses. The Black applicants were deliberately given sample profiles that were financially stronger than the white testers. Nonetheless 43% of the time, the white tester received preferential treatment.', 'Because our federal government does not like keeping racial data anymore, the SBA is not the best place to go to find out where the money went. But some states were more data oriented. In North and South Carolina, which have Black populations of greater than 20 percent, only 3 percent of PPP loans over $150,000 went to Black companies. It’s estimated that 90 percent of Black-owned firms were shut out of PPP funds, and that half of Black owned businesses may not survive the pandemic.', 'This is just part of a pernicious intergenerational caste system which suppresses the earnings and life options of Black Americans… what some people call “negative compounding interest.”', 'I advise everyone to read the magnificent book Caste by Isabel Wilkerson. I’m fascinated by her words that “the subordinated caste, too, has been fixed from the beginning as the psychological floor beneath which all other castes cannot fall.” Yet whites are falling too, and those who are falling blame Blacks and immigrants, when frankly, we don’t have enough power to dictate their lives. We — Black, Latino, non-white, and immigrant — are being left to feel the blows. The people beating us down blame us for crimes against the American way of life we did not commit.', 'As a practicing journalist, I believe our race and class caste system has been not only a Toni Morrison-style distraction, but something like a psychic privacy fence, keeping perfectly smart and privileged people — white and non-white — from understanding how desperate our nation has become. Part of that is because the work of Black, Latino, and non-white journalists has been suppressed decade after decade when it didn’t fit the cultural frameworks of our white managers. (Kerner Commission report, anyone? We’re reliving it half a century later.) We also have little access to capital to form our own enterprises, even though the time is ripe. Capital and deal flow affecting Black entrepreneurs is horrid and prejudicial. You can research for yourself. I have spent years researching facts, hoping that “one more thing” that Morrison spoke about would convince white Americans to invest in justice. I still do that sometimes, but I believe that white Americans have to take responsibility for doing data and social analysis to inform their lives, rather than requiring Black Americans to constantly justify our existence, values, and economic fortunes.', 'Perhaps asking white Americans to do more of their own research about race will actually add to the understanding of the gravity of our times. Perhaps not. In Caste, Isabel Wilkerson says: “It was common to hear in certain circles the disbelieving cries, “This is not America,” or “I don’t recognize my country,” or “This is not who we are.” Except that this was and is our country and this was and is who we are, whether we have known or recognized it or not.”', 'On a recent call my favorite high school teacher, who not long ago celebrated her 70th wedding anniversary and helped desegregate two schools, imagined a conversation with Shocked Good White People thus: “Join the world honey. This is it. You’re looking at it.”', '— — — — — -', 'I’ve been looking at it — meaning American reality, good and bad — for decades now.', 'My own family is an example of the caste system too. In every generation until mine, we have been forbidden to buy land in white areas (see: redlining), which diminished our wealth, and faced extreme job and salary discrimination. My grandmother paid an awful price — financial and psychological — for being a whistleblower about racial discrimination in her government job. She was vindicated in principle, and changed the system. But she never recouped the money she lost from seven years of being denied promotions and raises; spent her final years in financial anxiety; and died of medical malpractice I believe was related to racism.', 'She told me many tales about visiting her grandfather in Virginia, James Porter Montague, who served in the Civil War and was raised by a white family. Is this a happy inspirational story? Not quite. From what we know both from historical documents and family oral histories I did with elders, the white family was led by James’ father, who sold his enslaved mother downriver when the boy was nine years old.', 'What does it mean to be free ONLY to the extent that you have the indulgence of someone who also harms you? It sounds a lot like a metaphor for contemporary America.', 'Going down the generations, my family has fought in the Civil War, World Wars I and II, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. We are people who serve in many ways — as educators, doctors (a century ago as well as now), plus ecological scientists, programmers and engineers in my and our parents’ generation. All have faced discrimination.', 'My mother, a promising American journalist who worked in Zambia and interned at the Washington Post after graduate school, was shut out of American journalism based on race and gender. She became a teacher who worked two jobs to support me and my sister when we were young. At a recent dinner with CBS “60 Minutes” correspondent Bill Whitaker, he told me his father was also an aspiring journalist blocked by racial exclusion, as my mother was. Both of us are walking in the ghost footsteps of parents who never got to live their dreams.', 'So I have dedicated my life to journalism, and it has paid me back with a mix of joy and pain, visibility and lack of resources; lower earnings than people with less talent and seniority; and an inability to change systems biased against telling the truth. (The original “cancel culture” has been blocking Black and non-white contributions to our collective knowledge.)', '— — — — — — — — — -', 'But enough about the Black people and how the caste system has harmed us. What about whites?', 'That is not a sarcastic question. It’s a matter of life and death.', 'Today white Americans are dying of Covid-19 because of the secondary effects of anti-Black racism and anti-immigrant xenophobia. The election of Donald Trump would not have been possible without weaponized racial resentment. Any other president — white or non-white; Democrat or Republican — could have done more to stop the virus. But it’s not just the President. Even before he took office, our public health infrastructure was compromised by racial resentment in policymaking, from pandemic preparedness to Medicaid expansion.', 'Last year, Dr. Jonathan Metzl published the book “Dying of Whiteness: How the Politics of Racial Resentment is Killing America’s Heartland.”', 'In the book, he speaks with “Trevor, a forty-one-year-old uninsured Tennessean” living in low-income housing and dying from liver damage from hepatitis C. Neighboring state Kentucky adopted the ACA and Medicaid expansion, while Tennessee blocked it.', 'Trevor supported that. Quoting him in the book talking to Metzl: ‘ ““Ain’t no way I would ever support Obamacare or sign up for it,” he told me. “I would rather die.” When I asked him why he felt this way even as he faced severe illness, he explained: “We don’t need any more government in our lives. And in any case, no way I want my tax dollars paying for Mexicans or welfare queens.” ‘', 'Metzl says that Trevor died of dogma… “dogma suggesting to Trevor that minority groups received lavish benefits from the state, even though he himself lived and died on a low-income budget with state assistance. Trevor voiced a literal willingness to die for his place in this hierarchy, rather than participate in a system that might put him on the same plane as immigrants or racial minorities.”', 'Metzl adds, “The white body that refuses treatment rather than supporting a system that might benefit everyone is a metaphor for the decline of the nation as a whole.”', 'This is how we die, not just as individuals, but as a nation.', 'We die when Good White People — the white moderates Rev. King criticized as more detrimental to progress than the KKK — simply throw up their hands and say: “This isn’t the America I know!”', 'Well, isn’t it time to get to know America then? Specifically, I’d love privileged people to dress down, go to the Dollar General. Or go to Waffle House, order a coffee. You don’t even have to drink it. Just….listen. Listen to America. Preferably in many different types of working income communities.', 'In order to know America, I have met Klanspeople in a parking lot after a blizzard; talked to members of the Aryan Nation; been sexually and racially harassed by both sources and co-workers; and been… free. Give me a set of rental car keys and a tape recorder and I can show you the world. I have foresight, not in the mystical sense but because I’ve honed my ability to predict futures based on study of past patterns and constant meetings with people across the spectrum of race/class/gender/identities. And this is what I know:', 'No matter who wins this election, the culture wars will rage on. I predict that personal and property crime, including and especially white vigilante violence, will at least briefly intensify rather than subside after the election. And people will die.', 'Americans of all races will continue to die in part because hard liners, including wealthy ideology-driven funders, pushed the politics of racial resentment. White moderates assumed it wasn’t their problem. Now even some of the wealthiest white Americans cannot travel freely internationally on their private planes because people who only have US passports are global pariahs instead of global citizens. The children of the wealthy may not be able to go to college on campus in the fall, in large part because the weaponization of race and class made us “fail” the pandemic. And that, of course, is nothing compared to what working class people are going through. The willingness of many to ignore — or even leverage for personal gain — racial and class warfare made us less of a nation than we could be.', 'Let me repeat: This is how we die.', 'More specifically, if we do not change course, this is how we die both as individuals and as a nation, economically, physically, and spiritually.', '— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —', 'So how do we live?', 'We live by asking ourselves where we fit in America’s caste system; being honest about whether or not we care about fixing it; and if we do, being about it. We can take whatever role in the universe we occupy, from homemaker to Fortune 500 CEO, and begin a moral inventory about what our role is in solving our collective problems. We go to our areas of excellence, and imbue them with values that make our world better, in ways big and small. We have skin in the game. We lose sometimes. We don’t hoard resources while people are dying, or underpay essential workers. We examine systems of taxation, infrastructure, and education for long-term efficacy. We do not make ending the race/class caste system someone else’s problem.', '— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —', 'Let me touch on what companies and co-workers can do.', 'I recently went through a gut-wrenching moment where another woman of color (from a different race) and I spoke out about a company we both had worked at, and which harmed us both. Many white former employees spoke out in support of us. They named the top manager as the problem, and said he should do better. The only thing is — few of these same people spoke up when we were employed. We walked a lonely road in standing up for our dignity. In my case, I also stood up publicly for all the women in the company — who were overwhelmingly white.', 'I’m tired of fighting for people who don’t fight for me.', 'White people: If you see something, say something….. or don’t pretend to be an ally. I don’t need post-facto support. I just need to be paid fairly for the work I do and given a chance to perform in my zone of excellence.', 'And here’s a suggestion for companies and managers:', 'Pay people to do diversity work. Women and people of color have been going to boring useless diversity meetings for years, disproportionately doing the unpaid labor which in the end is not embraced by leadership. So: make your diversity committee competitive. Make people apply and state what they can offer; give people a fixed amount of money for serving; offer them a bonus if they do great work; and most importantly, reserve a pot of money that the vetted committee gets to disburse. Diversity work will never be meaningful if it continues to be done only by underrepresented groups for no money.', '— — — — — — — — — — — -', 'Let me circle back to Toni Morrison’s words on racism and distraction.

Black people live with mortality every damned day — our own, our families’, our communities’.', 'None of us will live forever. Our nation might not either.

It will not come without a personal cost to you, just as it has not come without a personal cost to me and others.', 'We breathe each others’ air.

You can read the full article with photos and illustrations here: mysexlifewithlola.com]', 'It’s November of an election year. And not just any election year, but perhaps the most vitriolic, divisive, and ugly election year ever. Well, except for 2016. As I’ve stated before, this sacred, sexy space of ours, this small column in the vast expanse of contemporary writing, steers clear of politics, except for the fact that nothing is a-political anymore. Writing about sex, celebrating sexuality, and depicting a strong, independent, sexually explicit woman like Lola Down is itself a political act.', 'But in this very politicized climate, it is nearly impossible to provide a playground where the ubiquitous partisan battles don’t bleed over the boundaries we have created. People on the right have appropriated the term “cuck” as a pejorative for the left. Queer men on the left have appropriated “Proud Boys,” to the consternation of that far-right group. Just beneath the surface of these slogans and slurs is a swirl of sexual energy, frustration, confusion, and subliminal eroticism misdirected and perverted into hatred and violence.', 'Misogyny, racism, sexism, gender identity politics, transphobia, homophobia, xenophobia, and politization of polyamory are all interrelated issues, impossible to easily separate into isolated questions.', 'We live in strange times; times I never thought I’d see. The President of the United States is a man married (his third marriage, mind you) to a woman born in a different country who had a career as a model, occasionally posing nude and with other nude women in homoerotic images. And yet, he’s not a radical leftist liberal, but embraced by the conservative Christian right! He has had numerous affairs with porn stars and other women, yet that hasn’t prevented him from gaining the backing of the Bible Belt. But his exoneration by the religious right has not been equally applied. Those who work in the sex industry were not similarly embraced or given the same shame-free-pass as the President.', 'In 2016 the first female presidential candidate was eviscerated, mainly for wearing a pantsuit. Yet, in 2020, between Hope Hicks, Kayleigh McEnany, Ivanka Trump, Omarosa Manigault Newman, Mercedes Schlapp, Lindsay Walters, Zina Bash, the First Lady, and others, it is sometimes difficult to tell the difference between the White House and the Playboy Mansion. Perhaps that is Trump’s appeal to many; he fills the void left by the death of Hugh Hefner.', 'And all of this tumult and turmoil, not coincidentally, floats to the surface in the wake of eight years of an African American man occupying the White House.', 'I mention our current and past political theater as a preamble to confronting a porn/erotica trope as ubiquitous and with as long a history as that of the “Lolita” nymphomaniac figure. I speak of the so-called “Mandingo Myth.” This deep-seated belief, whose pedigree can be traced as far back as Ancient Greece and Egypt, holds that African men wield sexual appendages that dwarf those of fair-skinned Europeans. Throughout the ages, the image of the hugely hung black man has been perpetuated as well as perverted in order to promote a racist agenda: The longer the penis, the more bestial the sex-drive, the less human the man and thus the greater the threat to white society, especially its womenfolk. (See A Mind of Its Own: A Cultural History of the Penis, by David M. Friedman, chapter III, “The Measuring Stick.”)', 'Over the centuries, the long black appendage has been compared to a Priapus (that is, the male fertility god), a donkey, stallion, buck, and even a pre-Adam serpent of the Garden of Eden responsible for Eve’s seduction and the Fall. Throughout the ages, but most prominently in America from Reconstruction onward, this archetype of the African American man’s exceptional endowment has been the focus of white fear and fetish, engendering multiple myths, none of them ending well for the African American man. This theme is almost comically depicted in the various King Kong films, but most explicitly in the 1976 version. Plot: The Petrox Oil Company seeks to plunder a remote island of its oil. They find no natural resources to make their venture profitable, but they do find and trap King Kong, a preternaturally large black ape. They return to the U.S. with their unusual cargo. However, Kong has fallen in love with Dwan (a scantily clad, blonde woman played by Jessica Lange). Unable to allow such an unfathomable relationship, Kong is killed. (In the original 1933 version, he climbs the giant phallus, the Empire State Building. In the ’76 remake, he climbs the World Trade Center buildings, thus doubling the phalli.) The allegory is quite transparent: white colonialists set out for raw materials, they return with slaves from Africa whose unusual size threatens their white women and must be killed.', 'A year earlier, in 1975, the same myth was played out, only without the allegorical trappings, in the film Mandingo, based on the 1957 novel by the same name, from which the “Mandingo Myth” gets its label, though its predecessors in white Western mythology predate it by millennia.', 'Unfortunately, today we still find this trope used as both the focus of taboo fetishes (“Blacked” porn, which fetishizes both black men with large cocks and white, usually blonde and petit, women) and phobias for political ends. For instance, in 2017, Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys, posted a tweet in which he asked if white women would be more willing to donate $20 to Trump’s campaign or walk past a group of black men while wearing a sundress. (The Daily Mail, 10/1/2020, “Leader of the Proud Boys is the State Director of Latinos for Trump”)', 'In today’s tribal public sphere, there is little we can agree upon, but one thing that is unimpeachable is, as David Friedman says, the one place where race and sex (and we can add politics) converge is the black penis.', 'The long black dong is the symbol of white, male fragility. It signifies the fear of masculine inadequacy and the homoerotic desire for sexual prowess. Both symbol and signifier are pointers and the thick, strong, dark schlong is frequently depicted as pointing at the helpless, weak, innocent white blonde. Copulation by contrast. This ubiquitous trope penetrates deep in the psyche of our culture.', 'Just as black men are often reduced to their primal virility as exemplified by the penis, so too women are subtly and explicitly made into a medium for the message communicated by the patriarchal culture. In recent memory, the collective unconscious probably recalls images from silent black-and-white films of a damsel-in-distress tied to the railroad tracks by the sinister mustachioed villain. This image is emblematic of an archetype that transcends time and space: the bound female. Ancient stories span the globe of women tied up — as sacrificial victims, concubines, slaves — from the abduction of Sita in the Ramayana to the afore mentioned Dwan of King Kong and, of course, Princess Leia in her famous Jabba the Hut scene in Return of the Jedi (1983) — project and perpetuate the idea of women as victims in need of a hero.', 'From nude or nearly nude women dancing in cages at clubs, raves, and music concerts, to Taylor Swift reenacting the railroad scene in “Mean,” this trope is conspicuously depicted and sexualized, but there are far more nuanced ways of sending the same message. What is the message? Women are weak, needy, helpless, and their power, like Prometheus (an example of gender inversion of the architype) is under wraps. Notice, if you will, women’s fashion, from undergarments to gowns. What is a recurring theme? Straps, bows, knots, strings, and all manner of imagery suggesting restraint while simultaneously revealing skin. Beyond that, almost every article of clothing is designed to depict weakness, vulnerability, and impotence. Watch your local or national news, for instance. How are the men dressed? Buttoned up shirts, ties, long sleeve jackets revealing the least skin possible. They are formidable, as if wearing body armor. And the women? Blouses cut at the shoulder, plunging necklines, form-fitting soft colored tops. Imagine for a moment what you would think of a male news anchor reporting in a halter-top made of thin, silky material.', 'Beyond the blouses, there are the skirts. Dresses were, perhaps, originally designed to conceal the shape of the woman hidden beneath all the folds and flourishes. But today, dresses and skirts are designed to inhibit freedom of movement, conceal as little as possible, and leave the woman wearing them vulnerable to the inadvertent upskirt.', 'Working our way down, we next arrive at women’s footwear. High heels keep a woman off balance. Not only do they prevent any aggressive action, they inhibit flight. Women’s dress shoes, for the most part, make them a helpless victim in the face of any danger. Beyond that, they continue the ligature leitmotif. Straps, bows, chords, all depict the female foot in a shibari shoe.', 'It’s important to recall that liberating oneself from the cultural baggage one inherits by virtue of merely being born into a particular time and place is not accomplished by merely adopting the opposite position. In the dialectical structure, inhabiting the antithesis merely reaffirms the thesis. It does nothing to diminish the power of the thesis. Rather, twisting free of the rigid and possibly oppressive cultural constraints is a tricky and subtle art. It requires first understanding the nature of one’s servitude and then becoming master of it.', 'Lola is by no means exempt from our culture’s conventions any more than you or I. However, she does like to play with the tropes and taboos just the way that a good composer doesn’t merely adhere to the rules of the times, but will surprise and delight by contorting them in unexpected patterns.', 'Of course, in our relationship there is the patent hotwife — cuck/stag — bull roles to be played. But we emphasize the play of that is inherent in any roleplaying. Lo has her soft spot for knots (of all variety) and strappy heels, dresses, bras, panties, and even corsets. She also has her wet spot for BBC. But it also delights her to wear her strap-on, to wield her cock, and to fuck like a man. Call her a switch if you wish. She also oogles and drools over the many fan photos she gets from black bulls endowed with length, girth, and heft she has rarely met in the flesh. But she also loves her male trans fans who send photos of themselves in their wives’ panties or cumming in their pantyhose. For, when it comes to sex, the one rule that holds is that nothing is essentially anything. Existence precedes essence, as the Existentialists mantra goes, meaning, before we had determined male/female, man/woman, straight/queer, black/white, there were just people doing stuff. Their names, definitions, categories, and expectations of norms all came later.', 'These observations are meant neither to condemn nor condone the complex cultural code with regard to BBC or BDSM as it manifests in veiled, seemingly innocuous symbols such as popular movies and fashion. Rather, this thought piece is more along the lines of semiotics (the study of signs and symbols in culture) than a cultural critique. Signs and symbols perform a function; they point at something. In this piece, the sign/symbol with which we began was the black penis, which is, innately and ironically, also a pointer. Perhaps it is pointing at our radical possibility for the future. I simply wanted to point that out.']"

In 2012, Hispanics, the nation’s largest minority, were for the first time a double-digit (10 percent) portion of the electorate. White voters were nearly 90 percent of Romney’s vote. In 1988, George H.W. Bush won 59 percent of the white vote, which translated into 426 electoral votes. Twenty-four years later, Romney won 59 percent of the white vote and just 206 electoral votes. He lost the nonwhite vote by 63 points, receiving just 17 percent of it. If the Republicans’ 2016 nominee does not do better than Romney did among nonwhite voters, he will need 65 percent of the white vote, which was last achieved by Ronald Reagan when carrying 49 states in 1984. Romney did even slightly worse among Asian Americans — the fastest-growing minority — than among Hispanics. Evidently, minorities generally detected Republican ambivalence, even animus, about them. This was before Trump began receiving rapturous receptions because he obliterates inhibitions about venting hostility.', 'Trump is indifferent to those conservative tenets (e.g., frugality: He welcomed Obama’s stimulus) to which he is not hostile (e.g., property rights: He adored the Supreme Court’s Kelo decision vastly expanding government’s power of eminent domain). So, Trump’s appeal must derive primarily from his views about immigration. Including legal immigration, concerning which he favors a “pause” of unspecified duration.', 'Some supporters simply find Trump entertainingly naughty. Others, however, have remarkable cognitive dissonance.

Some might be unwilling to blame Trump for the racism of his supporters. I am not unwilling; it should surprise precisely no one that Trump’s nativist, hate-filled campaign would attract racists to it. After all, we are talking about a candidate whose first response to the beating of a homeless Hispanic man by two thugs–one of whom “was inspired” by Trump’s anti-immigration language–was to say that “. . .

I know to “never take your eye off your drink” and “don’t walk alone at night” and “if you have to, put your key between your fingers to use as a weapon.” Even as a kid, I was taught not to talk to adult men I didn’t know. The message has been very clear: There are predators out there ready to take advantage of you, so be alert and prepared.', 'I’ve taken my role of self-protector seriously. I learned self-defense moves from a friend training to be a cop and felt ready to take down an assailant no matter their size or if they had a weapon. A therapist I worked with taught me to repeat the numbers “911” so I wouldn’t forget in an emergency. It sounds silly, but she said I’d be shocked at the number of people who get distraught and dial “411,” the number for local directory assistance.', 'Despite the years of effort and preparation, when I was sexually assaulted in 2005, I did not defend myself. I did not use my key as a weapon. I did not disarm the weapon he held against my neck. I did not dial 911. I didn’t even scream or move. I froze and complied.', 'The people who had guided and instructed me on how to respond to an assault neglected to explain how my body and mind would respond. I don’t blame them, because they didn’t know. In a practical sense, it’s true that training can prepare people to defend themselves and escape, but when it comes to cognitive functions, it’s not a given. And most people have no clue how the brain functions because basic neuroscience isn’t a core curriculum.', 'Understanding how the brain responds to emotional stimuli like fear would have saved me over a decade of guilt and anxiety.', 'To graduate high school in most U.S. states, you must understand cellular respiration, the sexual anatomy of a flower, and how to calculate the hydrogen ion concentration for a strong acid, but you don’t need to understand what controls your ability to function as a healthy, happy, well-rounded person.', 'Understanding how the brain responds to emotional stimuli like fear would have saved me over a decade of guilt and anxiety. It might or might not have allowed me to respond any differently to my assault, but it certainly would have changed how I felt about my response to it. In fact, it would have changed the entire narrative surrounding the event — things like victim-blaming and fear of reporting.', 'When society expects you to say no and defend yourself and you spend your life training to protect yourself but then you comply during an assault, you’re left with immense shame and devastating guilt about how your body responded. But imagine a police officer, a judge, or a victims’ hotline advocate with an understanding of how the brain really functions during trauma. We’d live in a world far more compassionate about how survivors actually react during assaults.', 'In offering a scientific explanation of why I froze during my assault and smiled afterward, I’m hoping to help people — whether they’ve been assaulted or not — understand why this response is so common. And I want those who have been assaulted to feel less alone and have less shame.', 'Trigger warning: details of sexual assault', 'During my senior year of college, I directed a low-budget, one-act play. To fund the production, I approached local businesses to ask if they wanted to purchase program advertisements and asked my friends to recommend locally-owned businesses where they had a connection. Some sorority members heard about my request and raved to me about a salon owner down the street from the school. “He’s the best!” they said. “He cuts everyone’s hair in the sorority. You’re going to love him! Book an appointment with him!”', 'I called the salon owner, told him about my production, and asked if I could set up an appointment to discuss advertising. He agreed to discuss it over a haircut, which he said he’d give me a great discount on.', 'The following week, I arrived at the salon and was surprised to see it completely empty of customers and hairdressers, except for one frustrated stylist cleaning her station and the owner. The owner led me to his chair and draped a cutting gown around my shoulders. In the mirror in front of me, I saw the stylist roll her eyes and leave. The tension between them was apparent, but what concerned me most was that I was then completely alone with someone I didn’t really know anything about.', 'The owner followed the stylist as she left and locked the salon’s front door behind her. He came back and began to cut my hair. There was something aggressive about his presence, the type of feeling you get around a sleazy guy who will do anything to get what he wants — a used-car salesman vibe. He didn’t ask how I wanted my hair cut or styled and instead went at it with an attitude of “I know what will look good on you. You don’t.”', 'As my hair fell on the cutting gown, he wiped it off. It was a peculiar gesture that gave me pause. I tried to remember all my haircuts in the past. Had other stylists brushed the hair off my gown too? I couldn’t recall a time when they did. His touch became more persistent and began to gravitate further down my body to my neck, my shoulders, my chest, and then my breast.', 'I interrogated myself harshly: “Why didn’t you leave? Why didn’t you scream?”', 'I kept asking myself, “Is he doing what I think he’s doing? Is he purposely touching my breast?” At first, I convinced myself that I was so small-chested that he just wasn’t aware of where his hand was landing. I continued to stare at myself in the mirror, the image of a broad man behind me, his pelvis resting against the back of the chair.', 'Before I had time to process what was happening, he paused from cutting my hair. He rested the sharp shears in his right hand against the base of my neck. His left hand continued to brush the cutting gown. There was no hair left on the gown, but he persisted. He worked his hand slowly down the front of the gown, groping my breasts several times before moving down toward my stomach, my thighs, and in between my legs. The gown prevented him from making full contact with my genitals, but he swept his hand along that area several times, applying pressure in the spots where the gown made contact with my body. His body was still pressed against the back of the chair, his chest pressing against my head.', 'I continued to sit, frozen, smiling politely, witnessing the assault in the mirror, feeling the cold metal of the sharp shears against my neck. It was a matter of minutes, but it felt eternal. When he was satisfied, he finished cutting my hair and told me the price. We never discussed the advertisement he’d said he’d wanted to purchase. I reached in my bag, handed him cash, smiled, said “thank you,” and walked to the door, which he unlocked, allowing me to leave.', 'When I got in my car, I was still frozen, mechanical, cold. It wasn’t until I drove away that I returned to myself and began to cry hysterically. At my house, I crawled into my bathtub and shivered and cried for hours. My mind played out the scene over and over again — his hands on my body, the heat of his body against mine, me giving him money and thanking him.', 'I interrogated myself harshly: “Why didn’t you leave? Why didn’t you scream? Why didn’t you take the scissors out of his hand and threaten him? Why did you pay him? Why did you thank him? Why didn’t you just tell him to stop?”', 'Believing fight or flight is our only response to threatening situations makes it easy to victim-blame.', 'Part of me felt like a victim, part of me felt like an idiot, and part of me wanted justice. I listened to that part. I called a local rape and sexual assault hotline and told them, in detail, what happened. I told them I had never filed a police report before or accused anyone of a crime and that I was 21 and needed some help. The response the advocate gave me triggered the same powerless feelings I felt in the salon chair. She said, “There’s nothing you can do. There were no witnesses, and you have no evidence. You could file a police report, but they won’t do anything about it except ask for his side of the story. They have no reason to believe you.”', 'I was infuriated and devastated. I called some close family members and told them what had happened; they only echoed what the advocate had said. The next day, I had a rehearsal for my play. I told everyone in the cast and crew. They were sympathetic but also didn’t have any advice about what actions I could take.', 'Every time someone confirmed what the rape advocate told me, I heard a voice that said, “You allowed this to happen. You let it happen.”', 'I imagined what would have happened if I had fought back: “Would he have tried to hurt me? That would have been evidence, right? If I had screamed and someone had heard me, they would be a witness, right? What if I had kicked him in the nuts on the way out? That would have been a defense, right?” Every scenario that conjured evidence and witnesses was in my hands, based on my actions. But my action during the assault had been to remain still and politely smile, to allow him to do what he wanted with my body. Why?', 'Most people know the phrase “fight or flight.” We’ve come to rely on it as an explanation for our behavior in times of high stress. The idea was first introduced by Walter B. Cannon in 1915. He observed that provoked animals released adrenaline, which gave their body the extra energy it needed to escape from or attack their predators. He proposed that human bodies work the exact same way. In some ways, he was right, but we’ve made many advancements and discoveries in the past century that shed light on our very complex response to stress. It turns out that humans don’t just run or fight when they’re scared.', 'I propose we get rid of this phrase entirely. It’s a false idea about instinct.', 'Believing fight or flight is our only response to threatening situations makes it easy to victim-blame. It becomes natural to think that if we’re only programmed to fight or run away, then anyone who doesn’t clearly wasn’t very threatened. What scientists and psychologists now understand is that the brain has a very intricate system of self-preservation. The first line of defense at certain times is not to immediately pump adrenaline but to slow down the prefrontal cortex.', 'Think of your brain like an electric grid. During a survival situation, you don’t lose total power to your prefrontal cortex — the area of the brain responsible for higher cognitive functions like decision-making, planning, and communicating emotion — but it does start to run on backup generators with certain non-essential functions shut down to conserve energy.', 'My prefrontal cortex was offline, and I didn’t have a choice to express my emotions because my brain had redirected power from that system.', 'This means when you’re faced with a threatening situation, you lose power to the part of your brain that can help you consciously decide what you should do next, understand how the situation will affect your future, make a detailed or complex escape plan, or tell your abuser that you’re not okay. It can happen instantly and often without your control. A different response can be re-trained, but it takes more than people just telling you to defend yourself when the time comes.', 'The brain takes that extra power to energize other parts deemed more necessary for survival, like the amygdala, which we have no conscious control over. It receives input from various parts of the brain and then sends action signals to other parts. It’s like middle management with tenure. When your amygdala receives the input that you’re in a threatening situation, it sends out the troops as necessary. But it does far more than just trigger adrenaline; it works in tandem with the hippocampus to assess the type of threat and respond in the most appropriate way. The hippocampus is your functional memory bank — the intelligent data storage the amygdala pulls from to figure out if it’s got a security protocol already in place for the type of threat.', 'Depending on the threat assessment, several things can happen in your brain and body, and this is why the oversimplicity of the fight or flight response is an outdated way of thinking. It’s possible you will be flooded with superhero levels of adrenaline that make you physically stronger and faster than you’ve ever been in your life. It’s also possible that your brain will see no way out and then activate your parasympathetic nervous system, which decreases heart rate and muscle tone, effectively freezing you in place.', 'And if you’ve ever had a similar threatening experience, your amygdala and hippocampus might deploy a remembered security protocol you previously created to cope that involves fawning, complying, or even laughing. These reactions are typically built up over time by people who experienced trauma as a child. Their brains have developed incredibly clever systems to appease abusers and avoid life-threatening situations.', 'I was abused at a very early age by a trusted figure. To survive that situation, I had to “be a good girl.” My brain developed a very smart fawning system that allowed me to protect myself by appeasing my abuser. I was not in control of this programming nor was I able to make the conscious decision to choose otherwise.', 'When I sat down in the salon chair in an empty locked room with sharp scissors against my neck, my brain didn’t give me the option to fight back. I was at the mercy of my programming — which meant I froze, smiled, and politely left before getting in my car and breaking down.', 'My prefrontal cortex was offline, and I didn’t have a choice to express my emotions because my brain had redirected power from that system. My parasympathetic nervous system weakened my muscles and decreased my blood flow to such an extreme that I was not able to physically move or respond. In that moment, I was the same little girl who had been abused before with the survival memory of “be a good girl.”', 'My silence was not consent, nor was the fake smile smeared across my face. Paying my abuser for my haircut and thanking him as I walked out the door was not an approval or forgiveness of his actions. It was survival programming, and it doesn’t make me weak or him any less guilty.', 'We cannot continue to rely on outdated assumptions about how people should respond to threatening situations. It’s imperative that we teach ourselves and others how the brain works, especially during moments of trauma and survival. Victim-blaming and shaming must end. We’re smarter and better than this.']"

Since then, I’ve done a lot of “personal work,” as they say, and I’ve basically reached a place of peace about the whole thing. But, for me, the final step was unexpected; it was understanding my own capacity to hurt other people.', 'When I began dating again, this one memory kept resurfacing for me in a way that was very disruptive. It was a memory of drunkenly making out with a girl when I had one of my hands on her leg, and I was slowly moving it up her thigh. “Oh, no,” she said, and I removed my hand and we continued making out. For months, this memory kept resurfacing, and I wondered— why is this memory coming up? I did nothing wrong, I listened to her when she said no. I’m not like Brad, I told myself. I didn’t assault her. I didn’t actually put my fingers in her vagina.', 'I’m not like Brad. I’m not like Brad. I’m not like Brad.', 'Yet, some small part of me couldn’t help but wonder; if I’d had two more drinks, could I have been like Brad? If that girl and I had been as drunk as Brad and I had been, could I have assaulted her?', 'I kept searching and searching for some clue, some concrete piece of evidence, that would exonerate me and I kept coming up short. And, eventually I came to terms with a very difficult belief I now have; it was simply circumstance that separated me and Brad. There was no deep evil in his heart, nothing terrible about him and nothing good about me. I had the same capacity to assault someone that he did, but the circumstances of the nights in question led to two different outcomes.', 'Once I accepted my potential culpability, I began to wonder to myself, what were the circumstances that made that event feel fucked up? Why did that night keep coming up for me as I was working on my sexual trauma?', 'One of the first things I observed, is that this girl had been very conventionally attractive. “Straight hot,” as the un-pc would say, or perhaps skinny, blonde and femme would cover it. And… I wasn’t really that into her. But I wanted to hook up with her anyway because I thought it would make me awesome. I could like, casually drop that I’d hooked up with her to my male friends and blow their minds. And even if I never told anyone about it, I’d know I’d done it, and this would feel like being “successful” in some way.', 'I’m sorry to say, this has been a repeated feature of my sex life. Any time a “straight hot” blonde chick wants to hook up with me (which has maybe happened, like, 3 times) I *always* go for it, and I basically never get turned on. But I get such an ego boost from being asked that I roll with it.', 'And, part of what was creepy about that night, is that I was hooking up with that girl for social status, not to connect with her. Of course I was tuned out to what she was feeling sexually; I was completely numbing my own sexual desires in pursuit of ego gratification. I wanted the feelings of success that would come after hooking up with her, but wasn’t much interested in the feelings of connection that came during hooking up. I wanted to fuck her as quickly as possible and get it over with just so I could say that I’d done it.', 'This revelation helped me answer one of the most painful question that had been haunting me; how can men be sexually gratified by me when I’m hurting? How could my sexual assaulter have gotten any gratification from fingering me when I was so drunk I was blacking out? How could my ex come inside me after I told him I didn’t want to have sex? Why did people get angry with me when I asked to stop sexual activity that was hurting me?', 'How could people enjoy, and demand, being sexual with my body when they could knew it was hurting me?', 'The answer, I believe, is that they were in pursuit of ego gratification. They were disconnected from what we both were feeling, and were instead focused on the “accomplishment” of hooking up with me. The gratification they wanted wasn’t the gratification of connecting with another human, but rather achieving something in the eyes of society.', 'Understanding this helped me come to terms with my own feelings of worthlessness and unlovability. For so many years, I looked around at other people — other women — and asked myself, “what does she have that I don’t?” Why does someone love her, and why does no one loved me? And, I think these feelings were caused by the visceral experience of callousness, and at times anger and resentment, by my partners in what were supposed to be “the most” intimate moments of my life. Some part of me felt like there was something wrong with me that led to other people being cruel to me when they were supposed to be being nice to me.', 'But, when I remember that night with the pretty blonde girl, it’s now so easy to see there was nothing wrong with her. I don’t believe she was unlovable; just that, in that moment, I was so selfishly focused on my own ego that I was unable to show genuine affection for her. Even if I didn’t do anything to her without consent, I think what I did was bad for her. I think I hurt her. She would have sensed I wasn’t really into her when we were making out, and that probably added to her own feelings of worthlessness and unlovability. I did to her what so many men have done to me, and for that, I am truly sorry.', 'One thing that #metoo hasn’t addressed is — what do we do when we realize that we are the guilty party? What do we do when we remember incidents in our past when we weren’t as good to people as they really deserved? Because, well before we get to “illegal” sexual behaviors, there are a whole slew of “harmful” sexual behaviors which many (most?) of us are guilty of.', 'I feel somewhat frustrated with our current demonization sexual assaulters, because it reminds me of the way I kept telling myself “I’m not like Brad.” It reeks of societal denial. We pull out the worst, most over the top cases of high profile men who assaulted many victims over years, and demand justice without ever investigating our own culpability or participation in a corrupt system. We retain a comfortable ignorance of our own attitudes and own complicity by vilifying the most odious as we secretly assuring ourselves we’re not like them.', 'One of my male facebook friends noticed that nearly all his female friends were participating in #metoo, and he wondered; have most men participated in an act of harassment, or are a small number of men harassing a lot of women? He assumed it was most likely the later, an assumption backed up with these high profile cases that target many people.', 'However, I think most of us *have* participated in the culture of sexual harassment in one way or another. There is not a sharp divide between the “evil” men in the headlines and a mostly innocent public; rather there is a spectrum that we will all find ourselves on.', 'Common ways I believe many people participate and perpetuate sexual assault culture:', 'My main frustration with me too, is that it’s making #4 harder and harder. Ultimately, as a culture, we’re going to have to admit the things we have done wrong. We’re going to have to admit the mistakes we have made, and examine the causes and conditions that led us to make them. We’re going to have to own up to the pain we caused other people, and this is going to involve feeling the pain that comes with fully acknowledging how you have hurt people.', 'We’re going to have to stop pretending the sexual assaulters are out there, that they’re committed by horrible people with horrible minds and repulsive sexual urges. Sexual assault is a natural and obvious extension of our culture. It is a natural extension of values that we all have internalized.', 'And, we’re going to have to figure out what to do about that. Right now, we seem to punish assault by calling people out on social media, shaming them, and make them un-hirable (if we can’t arrest them.) But, are we going to do that to everyone? What about the people who only did it once, a long time ago? What about the people who are combinations of victims and perpetrators? What about the people who did things that are kind of sketchy, but not fully criminal?', 'Our current methods of correction can’t be applied to the entire population, yet our entire population is culpable in this problem (which, is why basically *all women* have experienced it.) We must stop trying to confirm our own innocence, but rather consider the ways that we’re contributing to the problem. Because this is a very difficult task, I recommend starting with the easiest questions.', 'Have you ever looked away, or dismissed, someone’s experience of sexual pain — even a little bit? Even just in your head? Even online?', 'Have you ever felt flattered by, or craved, the attention of conventionally attractive people that you weren’t personally actually attracted to?', 'Have you ever called women “hot” as a way of connecting with straight men?', 'Have you ever shamed non conventionally attractive people?', 'Have you ever shamed anyone for being sexually inexperienced or a virgin?', 'Have you ever shamed anyone for having non-standard sexual desires?', 'I’m guilty of most of these (at some time in my life) and usually because I wanted social acceptance. Part of what I try to do now is accept a wide variety of people socially, to help mitigate the conditions that would lead to them being cruel to other people. Truly fighting rape culture will require large changes across the board. It will require being nice to adolescent boys. It will require creating space for a non-sexual kind of femininity.', 'It will require a culture that grants basic respect and dignity to all people, just because they are people.']"

I still remember one entry where I wrote, “Can you be raped without there being a rapist?” Even then I knew the answer, but I didn’t want to believe a guy I had thought was my friend could be become something so different.', 'Plays and concerts, $200I dragged friends and co-workers to numerous events, trying to fill my evenings and weekends, and to exhaust myself. I only told one why; she was amazingly supportive.', 'Therapy, $120I only did this for six months. I don’t like to talk about personal things with strangers, and I found therapy really, really hard. My work reimbursed me for all costs except transportation.', 'Self-care, $7,500My long-term healing and processing has largely been through an expensive hobby that challenges me mentally and physically, and provides a complete distraction whenever I need to get out of my head.', 'Clothes, $50I did not consciously replace the outfit I wore that night after I threw it out, but I guess it’s probably fair game to consider the next outfit I purchased more or less a replacement one.', 'Moving (replacement apartment), $1500So, the thing about being raped in your apartment is, you suddenly don’t want to be there. Ever. My panic attacks and flashbacks got pretty bad, and when I had the chance to move to a larger and cheaper place, I felt like I had been saved. That said, moving is always pricey: first and last months’ rent, boxes, movers, never getting all of your deposit back, an unexpected water bill for two years, etc.', 'Furniture, $0I kept my bed; I’d had it for years, and it never triggered anything for me, oddly enough. I kept it till I moved in with my boyfriend. I also still have the chair that was in my room that night; it’s a very comfortable chair. I find it empowering that I could pick and choose what I kept and what I discarded from that time, it is one way I regained control.', 'As I was drafting this list, I debated including my hobby since it is so much more than just a cost or consequence of the assault. And in many ways, the list is ongoing. It also reflects how incredibly fortunate I was in the aftermath: to have a supportive employer, to find the most amazingly wonderful and supportive partner a year and a half later, to have no long-term physical health consequences.', 'I also realized that I didn’t know whether to include things like more cab rides: even though the assault occurred in my home, I’m still more fearful on the streets and more triggered by street harassment as a result. Should I consider restaurant meals, massages, books, journals, movie tickets, tissues, Tylenol PM, etc., as life costs or as aftermath costs? My life is the aftermath, and it is all intertwined and messy.', 'Jennifer works in human rights, and lives with her fiancé and their bunny.']"

Note: We reached out to Ms. Reade for comment but she refused.', 'UPDATE 4/25/20: We have been in contact with a former boss of Reade’s who claims Reade stole from her non-profit animal rescue while she was a volunteer at the organization. Full details here.', 'Every allegation of sexual assault must be taken seriously, and the #metoo movement has certainly given the victims of sexual harassment and assault a greater shield of confidence in coming forward with less fear of being attacked themselves. With this said, however, it is the media’s responsibility to thoroughly investigate accusations before jumping into a story and allowing those allegations to potentially destroy another human being, or, in this case, a political campaign. Every woman deserves to be heard, but every media outlet still has the responsibility of investigating and then relaying to the public all of the facts at face value.', 'Alexandra Tara Reade came forward last week with quite disturbing allegations against former Vice President and current 2020 Presidential candidate Joe Biden. In April of 2019, Reade originally said that Joe Biden’s handsiness made her feel uncomfortable when she worked as a Senate aide in 1993. At the time, however, she said that she did not consider Biden’s actions to be sexualization, instead comparing her experience to that of being a beautiful lamp.', 'This story suddenly changed last week when Reade took part in an interview with podcast host Katie Halper. In the interview, Reade claimed that then-Senator Joe Biden “penetrated” her, against her will, with his finger, in an encounter that took place in ‘93.', 'While the allegations made by Reade are impossible to prove or disprove, examining Reade’s actions over the years and other evidence that has been archived on the internet, brings her honesty and integrity into question.', 'Below we will cover many of the inconsistencies in her story, the endless contradictions she has made over the years, and the evidence that paints a picture of someone who went from seemingly adoring Joe Biden and disliking Vladimir Putin in 2017, to someone who showed compassion and love for Vladimir Putin in 2018, to someone who accused Biden of doing horrific things to her in 2019 and 2020.', 'Alexandra Tara Reade has gone by many names and aliases over the years. According to our research, she was born as Tara Reade Moulton, before changing her name in her early 20s to Tara Reade, then changing it back to Tara Moulton again, and then changing it once again later in life (through marriage) to Alexandra Tara McCabe.', 'It appears as though sometime between 2017 and early 2018 she began calling herself Alexandra Tara Reade.', 'According to a website that she recently deleted, Reade is the founder of Gracie’s Pet Food Pantry, graduated from Seattle University School of Law, and was the co-host, creator and producer of a soul music radio show called “Soul Vibes” on KNRY — an AM radio station that serves the Santa Cruz and Monterey areas in California.', 'At one point in her life Reade worked on the domestic violence unit for the King County Prosecutor, in Seattle, WA, as a ‘Victim’s Advocate,” and on at least one occasion testified as an expert witness on domestic violence.', 'Reade also worked for former Congressman Leon Panetta, former Senator Joe Biden, and former California State Senator Jack O’Connell.', 'In 2017 Alexandra Tara Reade praised Joe Biden for his action in helping stop sexual assault, not just once, but on multiple occasions.', 'Between September of 2016 and May of 2017, Alexander Tara Reade used a Twitter account, under the name Tara McCabe, to spread praise of Joe Biden via tweeting, retweeting and liking various Tweets.', 'There are multiple examples of this, as seen below:', 'In the below instance, Reade retweeted a tweet by Margaret Cho that appears to commend Joe Biden for working with Lady Gaga to end sexual assault.', 'Then again in April of 2017, Reade liked a tweet by the Huffington post that praised the former Vice President for helping men realize how important they are in the fight against sexual assault. The article commends Biden for the steps he has taken to encourage men to take responsibility in stopping assaults against women.', 'Also in March of 2017, Reade made a tweet claiming that Joe Biden “speaks truth,” and encouraged her followers to “listen” to him.', 'In November of 2016, a few weeks after the election, Reade liked a tweet made by President Obama, wishing Joe Biden a “Happy Birthday,” and calling Biden “the best Vice President and friend” that he could have had.', 'Additionally, in January of 2017, Reade likes two tweets by the Obama WhiteHouse Archive, one quoting Joe Biden’s praise of Obama, and the other congratulating Joe Biden for receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom.', 'This means that between the time she claims to have been sexually assaulted by Biden, and the time that she publicly came forward with the allegations, she was spending time on Twitter commending her alleged perpetrator for helping end sexual assault among other things.', 'Additionally, in an article Reade wrote in 2009, she commended Joe Biden for action he had taken against domestic abuse, writing:', 'I should know what an abuser looks like. After all, I was working for then Senator Joseph Biden, who sponsored the Violence Against Women Act. But domestic violence is an equal opportunity offender.', 'In an article Reade wrote in 2009, she claimed to have left Washington DC for the midwest because her husband Tate, at the time, had received a job offer for a Congressman. She claims to have also received a job offer to work for a Governor’s race in California around the same time period.', 'Soon I received an offer to work on a Governor’s race in California and I almost accepted. Tate kept me up that night, pleading with me to go with him while he managed the Congressman’s campaign. I agreed and we moved to the frozen tundra of the Midwest. I would not even last a full winter.', 'However, in the article “Bring on the Light,” which Reade wrote in December of 2018, and has since deleted, she stated that she left politics and Washington DC because she was sick of American imperialism and because she “love[d] Russia with all her heart.”', 'Then in her article for The Union in April of 2019, her story changed yet again, blaming her move on Joe Biden essentially having her blacklisted.', 'Then, I went to Senate personnel for help. No one helped me. I resigned or I would say, I was forced to resign. I was told to look for another job. In the aftermath, I did not feel competent or worthy of anything. My self-esteem plummeted and my career nose-dived. What started with promise and possibility, ended because some prominent Senator decided that he liked my legs. I was sad and lost and moved on.', 'Also in an article she wrote on April 6, 2019, Reade claimed that she didn’t even know if Biden knows why she left working for him:', 'I wish I could say there was a happy ending, that Senator Biden apologized or that he helped make amends, he did not. I do not even know if he realized why I left.', 'But then in March of 2020, Reade says that Biden fired her:', 'Only one story can be correct.', 'There are plenty of other inconsistencies with her story, some of which have been outlined above.', 'For example, in Reade’s April 17, 2019 article for The Union, where she talks about her move to Washington DC to work for Joe Biden, she claimed to have driven across country to get to her destination.', 'I was beyond excited, I packed up my Nissan and cats, told my boyfriend goodbye and headed alone on the cross country drive to Washington D.C.', 'In 2009, however, the story was different. This time she arrived in DC on an airplane.', 'As the plane descended into Washington D. C., my Siamese cat, Cleo, meowed loudly from under my seat. Cleo had been through all my many moves, men, and a couple of Los Angeles earthquakes. As the lights of Washington D.C. reflected through the plane’s windows, the excitement of my new job as a Senate staffer lay ahead of me.', 'Additionally in January of 2020, Reade wrote that she was telling her story because of a picture the media has drawn conveying Joe Biden as a “champion of women’s rights.”', 'The reason I am writing about it is the hypocrisy that Biden is supposed to be the champion of women’s rights. Also, watch how the media coddles him.', 'She calls the concept of Biden being a champion of women’s rights a “hypocrisy,” but she too was boosting Biden as a champion of women’s rights in 2017 when she retweeted multiple tweets doing just this.', 'Using the same Twitter account that she was praising Joe Biden with, in 2017, Reade also used her presence on social media to attack Russia and condemn Vladimir Putin. Below are all tweets that Reade retweeted and/or liked in 2017:', 'On March 5, 2017, Reade retweeted a story by the New Yorker entitled “Trump, Putin, and the new Cold War,” which essentially outlines how Putin is at war against America and how he is trying to “damage American confidence and undermine the Western alliances — diplomatic, financial, and military, that have shaped postwar world.”', 'In February of 2017, Reade retweeted a tweet by Senator Kamala Harris, calling for an investigation into Russia’s involvement with the Trump campaign.', 'In March of 2017, Reade retweeted a Mother Jones article outlining all of the troubling links between Trump and Russia, and how Russia appears to have tried to subvert our Democracy.', 'On March 2, 2017 she liked a tweet by Chelsea Handler that attacked Jeff Sessions for lying about campaign meetings with Russian officials.', 'In February of 2017, Reade liked a tweet by Michael Moore sharing a story by the New York Times outlining Russia’s attack on our democracy, and how they infiltrated our political system.', 'In January of 2017, Reade retweeted an attack by Chelsea Handler on Russia for decriminalizing domestic violence. (More on this later)', 'Sure, there is absolutely nothing unusual about showing a disdain for Russia and Vladimir Putin, unless of course a year later you start to praise Russia and Putin.', 'That’s exactly what Reade began to do.', 'So where was Tara Reade right after she spent close to a year praising Joe Biden and attacking Vladimir Putin on Twitter, and right before she came forward with allegations against Joe Biden in 2019?', 'Reade was busy writing pro-Putin and pro-Russia tweets on Twitter, and articles for the Medium, which when the media found, she quickly removed from the internet.', 'In an article entitled “Why a Liberal Democrat Supports Vladimir Putin,” Reade seemingly believes that Putin is a loving figure that women find “intoxicating.”', '”President Putin has an alluring combination of strength with gentleness. His sensuous image projects his love for life, the embodiment of grace while facing adversity. It is evident that he loves his country, his people and his job.”', 'Reade continues,', '“President Putin’s obvious reverence for women, children and animals, and his ability with sports is intoxicating to American women”', 'For a leader who once was criticized for making light of rape, this certainly seems like an odd statement.', '“I say, ‘Well, he is very good to women, holds them in high regard.’', 'Recall that just a year prior, Reade was retweeting damning critique by Chelsea Handler of Russian legislation that Putin signed off on, which essentially made women helpless in instances of domestic abuse.', 'On December 17, 2018, Reade published another article entitled, “Bring on the Light.”', 'In this article, Reade wrote:', '“President Putin scares the power elite in America because he is a compassionate, caring, visionary leader.”', 'Let’s recall that a little over a year prior to this article, Reade was retweeting attacks of Putin for interfering in our elections, while also sharing disdain for Russian legislation that was demeaning to women. Now, however, Reade appears to attack America for trying to “trap” Putin with election meddling allegations.', '“President Putin is beloved by Russia and he not going anywhere. Instead of being ensnared in the recent political intrigues (and America is trying hard to set that trap). President Putin is keeping a calm focus on his own country’s development and future, without America. To President Putin, I say keep your eyes to the beautiful future and maybe, just maybe America will come to see Russia as I do, with eyes of love. To all my Russian friends, happy holiday and Happy New Year.”', 'In March of 2019, Reade also published another article, in Russian, that included a celebratory quote from Putin’s press secretary, rejoicing about the conclusions of the Mueller report. This article was also published in English.', 'In this article, dated March 26–27, 2019, Reade once again praises Vladimir Putin in quite a strange way, stating:', 'When the anti-Russia, anti-Putin propaganda starts up, personally, I shut down. I love Russia, I love my Russian relatives and friends. And like most women across the world, I like President Putin… a lot, his shirt on or shirt off.', 'There seems to be a recurring theme here. Reade loves to praise Vladimir Putin for his treatment of women and for his appeal to women, even though a year prior she was retweeting and liking tweets condemning Putin and Russia.', 'It’s also worth noting that this article, written less than a month before Reade came forward with her original allegations against Joe Biden, mentions Joe Biden in a seemingly positive way.', 'Whoever the democratic front-runner is for the 2020 Presidential run; Beto O’Rourke, the Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams ticket, Kamala Harris, or Bernie Sanders. We should urge these candidates to elevate the national conversation to more important matters.', 'It doesn’t end here though. Tara Reade also used her presence on Twitter to defend Vladimir Putin, even going as far as seemingly defending him for murdering journalists and those who speak out against him.', 'Then in September of 2019, 5 months after her original accusations against Biden, Reade was still praising Putin, and attacking Americans for being “anti-Russian”.', 'The problem is, she was one of those Americans attacking Russia and Putin in 2017.', 'Her praise of Putin continues, even into January of 2020:', 'And in February as well, as Reade defends Putin against those calling him a “villain.”', 'This praise of Putin seemed to only stop last week (late March of 2020), right after she came forward with her new sexual assault allegations against Biden, as her tune suddenly changed:', 'In a recent interview with Vox News, Tara Reade claimed that she only praised Vladimir Putin in 2018 and 2019 because she watched “a bunch of Noam Chomsky” and was working on a novel set in Russia at the time.', 'Also in April of 2019, Reade, in explaining her praise for Putin and Russia, wrote:', 'I am in a creative writing group and in writing a novel, the poetry is part of the novel and the blogs because I watch and read a lot of Noam Chomsky.', 'Reade, who previously wrote about being a victim of domestic abuse in 2009, told Vox News that now she no longer feels the same about Putin as she did in 2018–2019 because she has since learned more about domestic violence in Russia.', 'But, evidence shows that Reade was in fact knowledgable of Russia’s stance on domestic violence, a year prior to her writings. In January of 2017, Reade retweeted and “liked” a tweet by Chelsea Handler condemning Russia’s inhumane handling of domestic violence.', 'Additionally in the article “Bring on the Light,” which Reade wrote in December of 2018, and has since deleted, she stated that she left politics in Washington DC because she was sick of American imperialism and because she “love[d] Russia with all her heart.” Note: Reade moved out of Washington and to the West Coast decades ago.', 'But wait, didn’t she tell Vox News last week that she only praised Putin and Russia in 2018–19 because she was “watching Noam Chomsky” at the time? In 2018, she claimed to have always loved Russia since she left Washington DC over a decade ago.', 'But that wouldn’t add up either, considering she was attacking Putin and Russia on Twitter in 2017.', 'So here is the timeline. No matter how you spin it, it doesn’t add up.', 'There have been many accusations against Tara Reade, calling her a “Russian Agent.” It’s not our job to decide, and we must admit that this accusation seems pretty far fetched. However, in December of 2019, Reade did make quite an interesting tweet:', 'The article Reade appears to be referring to can be read here.', 'In 2017, Tara Reade could not praise Joe Biden enough for his politics, and his treatment of women. Then, suddenly in 2019, her tune began to change. Not only did she begin accusing Biden of workplace misconduct and then eventually sexual assault, but she was also pushing Russian/GOP conspiracy theories about Burisma.', 'Here is a more complete timeline of events, regarding Tara Reade’s actions toward both Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin.', 'A 2019 pro-Russia article, explaining her own experiences working in the U.S. Senate, appears to have been written by a man, in Russian.', 'In a now deleted article that Alexandra Tara Reade published in March of 2019, just weeks before coming forward with her original allegations against Joe Biden, a Russian source of ours caught something very unusual.', 'Both the Russian and English versions of the articles were published on the same date. However, the Russian version was published first, and was written in the the wrong gender. In referring to herself throughout the article, Tara Reade uses the masculine gender, as if the article was written by a male.', 'As you can see above, the masculine “л” is used on multiple occasions to refer to her own actions, as if she was a male, not a female.', 'For example, the following sentence', '“Аааа, я бы сказал, мой друг, это вопрос к другому дню.”', 'can be translated to:', 'Ahhh, I would say, my friend, this is a question for another day.', 'But the word “say” (сказал) is written in the masculine form rather than the feminine form (сказала).', 'The entire article appears to have been written this way. With this said, it is certainly possible that when she had the article translated someone messed up the genders. But that definitely begs the question of why should would want to publish her articles in both English and Russian? One of the first things you learn about when translating to, or writing in Russian, are the gender roles. Every Russian language source we’ve spoken to emphasized this.', 'So the only conclusion we can draw is that 1) Reade used a translation service such as Google Translate or 2) The article was written in Russian by a male and then translated to English.', 'Let’s examine a little further:', 'So, I am not watching our country with naïve or star spangled eyes or any other nation.', 'In English the sentence doesn’t seem make much sense? Any English writer would phrase it more like:', '“So, I am not watching our country, or any other country, with naive or starry eyes (star spangled eyes).”', 'You can decide for yourself.', 'No, no one will be able to say with certainty whether Tara Reade’s latest allegations are legitimate or not, but the very least we can do is ensure that the public has as much information as possible to make an informed decision. That’s the purpose of this article.', 'With that, we leave you with two things to think about', '#1) A tweet response made by Reade just weeks before coming forward with new allegations seemingly contradicting her original story, and just days before The Daily Beast reported on the Russian media becoming concerned with Joe Biden’s resurgence. As you can see it seems as though Reade is admitting that she’s waiting for the perfect time to release her new allegations in order to hurt Joe Biden’s campaign:', 'And #2) A tweet response that Reade made to the parents of accused rapist Julian Assange. She called the man “a hero”.', 'Note: UPDATE 4/2/20: We were able to contact a longtime friend of Reade’s who wished to remain anonymous, but they said they “do not believe her allegations,” claiming she has always been one to seek attention. We went out of our way to get Reade on the record to defend herself and also spoke to individuals close to her for years in an effort to get someone to tell us that Reade was telling the truth. Those we spoke to could not do so and in fact left us even more convinced that things don’t add up.', 'UPDATE 4/25/20: We have been in contact with a former boss of Reade’s who claims Reade stole from her non-profit animal rescue while she was a volunteer at the organization.

It’s a part of my life that I wanted to keep buried forever because it filled me with such shame, not just the fact that I was sexually assaulted, but the fact that the faculty of Harvard Law School actually voted on whether to take away my degree for speaking up about it.', 'The last thing I expected would happen to me at Harvard Law was sexual assault.', 'I was only eighteen years old when it happened, having skipped several grades, gone to college at 13, a first generation immigrant, a young woman of color who had overcome poverty and beaten the impossible odds to get in. The last thing I expected would happen to me at Harvard Law was sexual assault.', 'I remember my attacker telling me after the assault, “I should probably go to church for what I just did to you.” This followed by “And you should probably take a shower.” I did take a shower. I wanted to take a million showers. The showers did little to assuage the fact that we went to the same school. His apartment was across the street from my dorm. He sat behind me in one of my classes.', 'I saw him nearly every day, at law school events and law firm interviews. Whenever I saw him, my stomach would twist into a knot so tight, I felt like I was going to hurl. In the weeks that followed, I went the university nurse, got the rape tests done, told the Dean of Students what happened, switched dorms, and filed an anonymous report to the police.', 'Whenever I saw him, my stomach would twist into a knot so tight, I felt like I was going to hurl.', 'None of this was enough when I filed a formal complaint against him. Harvard Law School at the time adhered to the “clear and convincing evidence” standard, a higher standard for rape victims which Secretary DeVos is now allowing schools to go back to.', 'Despite this incredibly high standard, in my third year of law school, I filed a formal complaint in Harvard Law School’s administrative board against my attacker. Graduation was fast approaching and I couldn’t bear the thought of my immigrant parents having to witness their daughter getting her diploma next to the guy who sexually assaulted her. So I talked to the new Dean of Students as well as the Dean of Harvard Law School and brought charges of sexual assault in Harvard’s Administrative Board.', 'The Ad Board is Harvard’s own mini-court system, the “jury” made up of faculty members and students. In order to proceed with the ad board, the law school required me to write and sign a document saying I would not bring a criminal complaint with the police. I signed it, thinking that the institution that stands for justice would find justice on my behalf.', 'Harvard Law School required me to write and sign a document saying I would not bring a criminal complaint with the police.', 'The “trial” required me to sit in a room in front of my attacker and listen for hours as he called me a liar — a traumatizing and soul-crushing cross examination process, which Secretary Devos now wants to make mandatory on campuses. Still, I presented my evidence as best I could, including emails and health services records. In the end, Harvard Law School still found my attacker not guilty.', 'Then, the other shoe dropped: the university was now investigating me for “malicious prosecution.” The days that followed were the darkest ever as I waited for the faculty to vote on whether to yank away my own diploma. The law school told me that I could make the whole thing go away if I just dropped the charges. My traditional Chinese parents urged me to consider backing down, worried if this got out, it would bring shame to me and my family. But I refused to drop the charges. My voice was my armor.', 'Then, the other shoe dropped: the university was now investigating me for “malicious prosecution.” The faculty was voting on whether or not to take away my diploma.', 'The day I was found “not guilty” was one of the most heart-wrenching days of my life. I was relieved; and gutted in my relief that the only justice I got for being sexually assaulted was I was allowed to keep the degree I earned. A faculty member actually came up to me afterwards and said, “Congratulations! You get to graduate! Let me give you a bit of advice. Move on!”', 'I did move on, sort of. I moved away from law, having had my entire legal education hijacked because of this experience. I started teaching and writing. I stuffed what happened to me in a shoebox until 2014, when the Department of Education found that Harvard Law School was “in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 for its response to sexual harassment, including sexual assault.”', 'The Dept of Education found multiple cases of sexual assault where the school failed to respond appropriately. Tears streamed down my face when I read the words — all this time I thought I was all alone. Reading the report was like turning on a light in a dark cave; I had no idea there were others.', 'Harvard Law School issued a statement in response: “Harvard recognized that we could and should do more.” They are the closest to an apology that I’d ever received from the institution that I felt wronged me, an institution I admired since I was a little girl.', 'All this time I thought I was all alone. Reading the report was like turning on a light in a dark cave; I had no idea there were others.', 'The Department of Education findings — coupled with witnessing the bravery of all the women who stepped forward in the Harvey Weinstein case — empowered me to finally share what happened to me in PARACHUTES, my debut young adult novel about two girls who experience sexual misconduct in an elite private school and the length the school goes to cover it up.', 'While I can never get back those three years of law school, I hope that in telling my story, more schools will prioritize protecting the students, not the brand. I hope what happened to me serves as a cautionary tale for the new rules on campus sexual assault that Secretary DeVos just finalized. If implemented, they will make us go back to a system which in my opinion works against the victim. They will dilute the courage of so many women in coming forward and speaking out — myself included. They will make it that much harder for victims of sexual assault and sexual misconduct to seek and find justice.']"

For those of you who haven’t read it, it’s the story of a girl, “Grace,” who went on a date with Aziz Ansari, the writer and star of the Netflix show Master of None, and was sexually assaulted.', 'But part of the reason I’ve been wrestling with this article is because I, like many, many, many others, am having a hard time convincing myself that this was, in fact, a sexual assault.', 'Part of this uncertainty comes from the fact that the conversation about what constitutes a “sexual assault” is a reasonably nascent one. Depending on who you ask, sexual assault can encompass everything from the ickiness of the bad date described in the short story Cat Person to the disturbing atrocities committed by the likes of Harvey Weinstein.', 'Another part of my uncertainty comes from wondering how much of sexual signaling is lost in translation. It seems obvious that a verbal “no” is impossible to misread, but at the same time, we live in a world where the media encourages women to say “no” when they mean “yes” and “yes” when they mean “no.”', 'And, possibly the biggest part of my uncertainty comes from the fact that if this counts as sexual assault, then I’ve been sexually assaulted. Multiple times.', 'From the dozens of comment threads and articles I’ve seen around this topic, I know what the answers to my questions are.

For pretty much just as long, according to a bombshell report from the New York Times, Weinstein has been serial sexually harassing aspiring young actresses who come into his orbit.', 'The Times offers a lengthy list of women, some of them now famous, who were allegedly subjected to Weinstein’s lewd overtures, including Ashley Judd, who says Weinstein requested she watch him shower and Rose McGowan, whom Weinstein gave a settlement in 1997 following “an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival.”', 'There were at least eight more hush money pay outs, per the Times, to recipients including “a young assistant in New York in 1990, an actress in 1997, an assistant in London in 1998, an Italian model in 2015 and [former Weinstein Company employee Lauren] O’Connor shortly after.” With a traceable track record like that, it’s almost impossible to believe that there aren’t other women who chose to keep quiet rather than take on one of the most powerful men in Hollywood.', 'In response to the Times report, Weinstein released a statement that is an ostensible mea culpa but reads more like a perfectly written example of things not to do when you are apologizing. Let’s run through some of the highlights, shall we?', '“I came of age in the ’60s and ’70s, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different. That was the culture then.”', 'I came of age at a time when the workplace was where men went to compare dick size with other men, and then we’d have our secretaries — or “skirts,” as we called them — judge who won.

I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it. Though I’m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go. That is my commitment. My journey now will be to learn about myself and conquer my demons.”', 'Well, this seems like progress, right?', 'Just wait.', '“Over the last year, I’ve asked [celebrity lawyer] Lisa Bloom to tutor me, and she’s put together a team of people. I’ve brought on therapists, and I plan to take a leave of absence from my company and to deal with this issue head on.”', 'Lisa Bloom told the Times that Weinstein is “an old dinosaur learning new ways” and that she “explained to him that due to the power difference between a major studio head like him and most others in the industry, whatever his motives, some of his words and behaviors can be perceived as inappropriate, even intimidating.”', 'What’s weird about this is that I’m pretty sure Weinstein already understands the power differential at play between him and “most others in the industry,” particularly hopeful actors. One woman who temped for Weinstein said he told her that “if she accepted his sexual advances, he would boost her career.” O’Connor said that Weinstein’s targets were almost invariably “vulnerable women who hope he will get them work.” Weinstein — a six-time Oscar winner and titan in the film industry — understood with crystal clarity his own status vs. those he allegedly dangled careers in front of for varying sexual favors. Alleged sexual harassers and abusers such as Bill O’Reilly, Bill Cosby and Roger Ailes, among many others, use their power against those who have none. That’s how this whole awful thing works.', 'I’m pretty sure Weinstein already understands the power differential at play between him and ‘most others in the industry.’', 'Also, for the record, the fact that Weinstein reportedly used his fortune to pay off women and keep all those charges quiet suggests he’s well aware that his behaviors are “inappropriate, even intimidating.”', '“I so respect all women, and regret what happened.”', 'God. That “so” is really not helping here. Someone should’ve read this thing out loud before they sent it out.', '“Jay Z wrote in 4:44 ‘I’m not the man I thought I was, and I better be that man for my children.’ The same is true for me.”', 'Honestly, Harvey Weinstein borrowing a Jay-Z lyric about his marital infidelity to Beyoncé to describe his contrition about harassing who knows how many women over the last 30 years is just too much to get into right now. (Who is that arbitrary insertion even for? The “kidz”? Maybe in his next sorry-not-sorry letter he’ll quote Lil Yachty or something.) It is worth noting that the line isn’t an actual Jay-Z quote, just to give you a sense of the real time and heartfelt labor that went into this thing.', '“I want a second chance in the community, but I know I’ve got work to do to earn it.”', 'What community? You mean Hollywood? Mel Gibson is on the up-and-up these days and the Golden Globes gave Woody Allen a Lifetime Achievement Award just three years ago. Fox News fired Bill O’Reilly six months ago and then welcomed him back last month like an esteemed honoree at a medal ceremony.

Trust me, this isn’t an overnight process. I’ve been trying to do this for 10 years, and this is a wake-up call.”', 'Wait, so according to Harvey Weinstein, he’s been trying to “do this” — meaning “be better” we presume — for “10 years”? I would genuinely love to hear what kind of all-powerful pervy forces have been forcing Harvey Weinstein — the man whom 90 percent of Hollywood is legit afraid to piss off — to keep sexually harassing women for the last decade.', 'Here’s where it really gets good by which I mean off the g.d. rails.', '“I am going to need a place to channel that anger, so I’ve decided that I’m going to give the NRA my full attention. I hope Wayne LaPierre will enjoy his retirement party. I’m going to do it at the same place I had my Bar Mitzvah. I’m making a movie about our President, perhaps we can make it a joint retirement party.”', 'On the heels of the latest mass shooting, many of us welcome any takedown of the NRA. And considering his historic unpopularity, it’s always nice to hear mention of Trump no longer having access to the nuclear codes. But the whole tone of this section verges on the bizarre, that is until you remember you are in the midst of a pissing match, midstream. “I’m going to throw you a party in the same place where I became a man, which you should consider a direct threat to your own manhood through some convoluted illogical thought stream I won’t explain.” Or something.', 'You are in the midst of a pissing match.', 'Anyway, if there are three people who seem perfect for some sort of man-off, it’s Weinstein, Trump and the head of the NRA. So there’s that.', '“One year ago, I began organizing a $5 million foundation to give scholarships to women directors at USC. While this might seem coincidental, it has been in the works for a year. It will be named after my mom, and I won’t disappoint her.”', 'I guess that’s a good thing. Let’s just be sure every scholarship includes a clause that states, “You are in no way now, nor in the future, beholden to Harvey Weinstein.” Just be safe.']"

Some have also clarified why they’re not capitalizing “white.”', '“Black is an ethnic designation; white merely describes the skin color of people who can, usually without much difficulty, trace their ethnic origins back to a handful of European countries,” wrote Mike Laws in the Columbia Journalism Review on June 16, before the article was updated with revised language. Dean Baquet and Phil Corbett of the New York Times wrote that “there is less of a sense that ‘white’ describes a shared culture and history.”', 'Unfortunately, this choice runs the risk of reinforcing the dangerous myth that White people in America do not have a racial identity.', 'I haven’t always capitalized “White” in my own writing, but I do now. Here’s why.', 'Whiteness is not only an absence. It’s not a hole in the map of America’s racial landscape.

We were collectively reminded of that this past week, when Mark and Patricia McCloskey of St. Louis stood outside their home pointing loaded firearms directly at peaceful protestors making their way down the street. In that moment, the McCloskeys held the lives of strangers in their hands. They could have murdered any of those Black people that day, and history both distant and recent suggests that they may have been able to do so with total impunity.', 'When we ignore the specificity and significance of Whiteness — the things that it is, the things that it does — we contribute to its seeming neutrality and thereby grant it power to maintain its invisibility.', 'Meanwhile, Black people, from Tamir Rice to Darrien Hunt to John Crawford, and countless others whose names we may never know, have been murdered for holding, respectively, a toy gun, a fake sword used for cosplay, and a BB gun. Tamir Rice will never drive a car or go to college. Darrien Hunt will never attend another nerdy convention or watch anime again. John Crawford will never again hug his baby boys, Jayden and John Henry IV. The McCloskeys, who are personal injury trial lawyers, live on.', 'The stunning incongruousness of these facts — that a 12-year-old with a pellet gun would be murdered on sight in the same country where Mark McCloskey could stand openly in the street brandishing a semi-automatic rifle and his wife could point a pistol directly at passersby, rage contorting her face — rests not only on the Blackness of Rice, Hunt, and Crawford. It rests also on the Whiteness of the McCloskeys: the veneer of presumed innocence, respectability, and righteousness that protected them like a shield on that day. This shield ensconced their bodies, and their Renaissance-style palazzo, all of which remain intact and unsullied at the time of this writing. This shield protected Dylann Roof on his way to Burger King. It protected the still-unnamed woman who is seen in a recent viral video screaming at people and throwing food in Trader Joe’s, who was unharmed though police were called in response to her behavior. It protects White children in public who are screaming or running or touching things they shouldn’t touch, while Black parents grasp their children tightly in fear that similar behavior could cost them their lives someday. It’s a phenomenon all its own, something bigger than being not-Black or not-Indigenous or not-Asian.', 'Perhaps the only thing more remarkable than the powers of this shield is its seeming invisibility, which permits White people to move through the world without ever considering the fact of their Whiteness. This is an incredible feat, through which White people get to be only normal, neutral, or without any race at all, while the rest of us are saddled with this unpleasant business of being racialized.', 'I’m reminded of the highly autonomous robots of the HBO series Westworld, which are programmed when they are faced with incontrovertible evidence that they are robots to reply simply, “Doesn’t look like anything to me!” This is a great phrase to use next time an organization proudly tweets a photo of its all-White class of congressional interns, or television writers’ room, or nonprofit board of directors. These people and organizations share such photos in a cloudy bliss, the shield surrounding them, protecting them from self-doubt or displeasure. When the rest of us raise the alarm, they squint at the photo, confused. “Doesn’t look like anything to me!” And with that quick, easy magic, Whiteness remains invisible, and as is the case with all power structures, its invisibility does crucial work to maintain its power. In maintaining the pretense of its invisibility, Whiteness maintains the pretense of its inevitability, and its innocence. As long as White people do not ever have to interrogate what Whiteness is, where it comes from, how it operates, or what it does, they can maintain the fiction that race is other people’s problem, that they are mere observers in a centuries-long stage play in which they have, in fact, been the producers, directors, and central actors.', 'Language and racial categories have some important things in common: They are fluid, they are inherently political, and they are a socially constructed set of shared norms that are constantly in flux as our beliefs and circumstances change.', 'Other than the demonstrably untrue idea that White “merely” describes skin color, there are other interesting arguments to consider for keeping it lowercase. For instance, many Black people I know say that they capitalize Black as a show of respect, pride, and celebration, and they don’t want to afford the same courtesy to Whiteness. But we frequently capitalize words for reasons other than respect — words like Holocaust, or Hell, which can be capitalized to indicate specificity or significance. When we ignore the specificity and significance of Whiteness — the things that it is, the things that it does — we contribute to its seeming neutrality and thereby grant it power to maintain its invisibility.', 'Some outlets have also noted that White supremacist hate groups capitalize White, so we shouldn’t. To that, I respond with an ancient African American proverb: I ain’t studdin’ them.', 'Ultimately, it’s good that we’re having this public conversation. Plenty of other scholars who study race and racism will disagree with me on this, and that’s fine. In fact, I disagree with myself from two years ago. In my own 2018 book, Ghosts in the Schoolyard, which is about schools and racism in my hometown of Chicago, I capitalized Black, but not White — a fact that an astute undergraduate student of mine noticed last year and asked me about, noting that my class slides now include a capital W. I told her that after thinking about it some more, I changed my mind. I might change my mind again. Language and racial categories have some important things in common: They are fluid, they are inherently political, and they are a socially constructed set of shared norms that are constantly in flux as our beliefs and circumstances change.', 'The terms we use, and the ways we write them, are less about saying or doing the “correct” thing, the thing that will prevent you from getting flamed on Twitter or earning an eye roll in a staff meeting. Rather, it’s about what we want words to do for us and the arguments we’re trying to make about ourselves and the world through the words we choose.', 'So, what am I trying to do when I capitalize White? One of my favorite sci-fi tropes is the archetypal scene in which a character tests whether an invisible force field is present by throwing something at it and then standing back cautiously to observe the almost-imperceptible buzz at the moment of impact. Where there appears to be nothing at all, there is, in fact, danger. That’s what I hope to do, in a small way, when I capitalize White. I’m throwing a stick at the force field around the McCloskeys. I’m trying to say, in a small way, “I think there’s something there.”']"

I have felt shame and guilt for having bought into my family’s lie, for passing, and for distancing myself from the few African Americans in my community.', 'In middle school, two of my Black classmates approached me and asked if I wanted to join their group. They didn’t say “group of Black students,” but I knew what they meant. I said no. Their recognition of our shared identity made me uncomfortable because I had been taught to see Blackness as “less than.” The white me couldn’t risk being associated with them. That feeling led me to reject the offer of friendship from kids who, like me, were trying to find a group where they belonged.', 'My identity journey has been complicated by my mother’s claim that my biological father was an unknown man who raped her. For a long time, her story made it difficult for me to feel pride in my Black roots. The possibility that my mother had lied about this muddled my feelings even more.', '“We wouldn’t be having this conversation if he had been white,” my mother said during one of our many arguments about my desire to know my biological father. She was right. If the man who had impregnated her had been white, I may never have known that I had a different father than my brothers. If he had been white, she may not have even known that I wasn’t my father’s child. If he had been white, there would have been no secret to keep.', 'To say that my biological father was a Black man who raped my mother sounds like the most terrible racist cliché. It was the warning slave owners intoned about keeping sexually rapacious Black men away from their pure white women. I was still learning about Black history when I discovered my identity, but I knew about Emmett Till, who, at fourteen, had been beaten to death for allegedly whistling at a white woman. I knew there was a mythology built around Black rapists targeting white women, but I felt compelled to believe my mother.', 'For years I was torn between my Blackness and my gender. Was I supposed to feel more sympathy for the Black man or the white woman in the story? By telling her story, my mother had drawn a line, and I would have to decide where I stood.', 'If I believed her, I would have to disavow my blackness; if I decided to explore my Black heritage, I would betray her. I had landed in an ethical checkmate: if I rejected her truth, I was denying her rape. If I accepted her lie, I was standing with the slave owners who demonized Black men. With no clear answer, I adopted my mother’s shame for my blackness, which revealed her dirty secret, whatever it was.', '“You came from me. You’re white because I’m white,” she said during another of our arguments. I couldn’t understand why she subsumed my identity beneath her own. The answers are racism and white privilege, but gender plays into the formula as well. It was not just my being a white person that was at stake, it was my being a white woman. Without realizing it, my mother had revealed that her gender values were rooted in race.', 'I realized that growing up, she wasn’t just teaching me how to be a woman, she was teaching me how to be a white woman. Attractive, educated, accomplished, worthy — these were qualities that my mother assumed were only achievable if I continued to be white.', 'Publishing my memoir made my family’s secrets public, cementing the wall between my mother and me.', 'Since publishing the memoir, readers have asked if I feel forced to choose between Black and white. My first instinct is to say “no”. I acknowledge myself as a mixed-race person who grew up in a white family and identifies as Black and biracial. I have a relationship with my white family and appreciate my European heritage, even though it is a space in which I will always be othered.', 'As a woman, I identify as Black and mixed-race. My friends and I share the experience of being black women in the world, even if we come from different backgrounds. I identify as mixed-race because, in addition to having one Black and one white parent, being light-skinned and having mixed features gives me an advantage in the matrix of colorist, Europeanized beauty standards that have historically (and artificially) privileged mixed and light-skinned women.', 'A reviewer of my memoir wondered why I could not “be white” in the same way that I could be Black or mixed. This might seem self-evident; white identity is by nature exclusionary, and being mixed invalidates my claim to whiteness. How people of mixed heritage identify is a perennial issue, and everyone must answer that question for themselves. For me, accepting whiteness meant rejecting parts of myself that had been erased for too long. Although I lived as white until I was 27, I am not white-passing. My Black roots are obvious. Even when I thought I was passing, the real possibility of people believing I was white was absurd.', 'Despite being a person of color, my whiteness remains a blind spot. Even though I have worked for years to rid myself of internalized racism, I have not been able to decouple my white identity from its inherent privilege. Like others grappling with the legacy of white supremacy, I yearn to see myself as part of the solution, not the problem.', 'Storytelling gave me a framework to approach these issues in all their messy complexity without resorting to facile identity politics. Letting my new-formed self develop on the page, not linearly, but with ragged-edged grief and the constant doubling back of memory, the fragments that emerged formed a whole.', 'To others grappling with the same questions, realize that some (or a lot) of the racism you internalized will always be with you. As much as you want to, it cannot be erased. Instead of seeking to become more righteous and less culpable, own your error and let the page guide you to reflect on how whiteness has privileged you, even if it is a source of pain.', 'For mixed-race individuals, forgive yourself for being racially illegible and for choosing an identity that minimized that discomfort.', 'For white individuals, acknowledge that we live in a society that positions whiteness as “self” and people of color as “other.” If your goal as an ally is to make more space for the “other,” your allyship has already failed.', 'Instead, position whiteness and yourself as “other” and talk about that experience. If you are brutally honest, you will acknowledge that your life as a white person is rooted in your failure to recognize the humanity of the “other” and in your desire to separate yourself from them.

White people are stepping aside so that Black, Indigenous, and people of color can access the many platforms that have silenced them for generations. The message, loud and clear, is that Black Lives Matter. Our stories, ideas, and experiences matter.

My name and my story were the top trending topic in the world. I have kept silent at the advice of friends and mentors, who thought we could just ride out the hate until it went away, but I will do so no longer. It wasn’t working. This is a new time.', 'The reports about my race, about my past, and about the pain I’ve endured are all lies. My mother is a senior citizen. I refuse to speak in detail about the nature of my mother’s past, or her sexual partners, and I am gravely embarrassed to even be saying this now, but I have been told for most of my life that the white man on my birth certificate is not my biological father and that my actual biological father is a light-skinned black man. My mother and I have discussed her affair. She was a young woman in a bad relationship and I have no judgment. This has been my lived reality for nearly 30 of my 35 years on earth. I am not ashamed of it, or of who I am — never that — but I was advised by my pastor nearly 20 years ago that this was not a mess of my doing and it was not my responsibility to fix it. All of my siblings and I have different parents. I’m actually not even sure how many siblings I have. It is horrifying to me that my most personal information, for the most nefarious reasons, has been forced out into the open and that my private past and pain have been used as jokes and fodder to discredit me and the greater movement for justice in America. I resent that lies have been reported as truth and that the obviously racist intentions of these attacks have been consistently downplayed at my expense and that of my family.', 'For my entire life, I have held the cards of my complicated family history very close to my chest. I preferred to keep it that way and deeply resent that I have been forced to authenticate so many intimate details of my life to prove who I really am. This, in and of itself, is a form of violence. The same sources who falsely reported my family history — including Breitbart, the Daily Caller, and The Blaze — have also falsely reported that my wife and I were never in a brutal car accident, that I lied about how many kids we have (we have 5 now, but have had more/less because we’ve fostered, adopted, housed many of our nieces and nephews), that I lied about my race to get a scholarship from Oprah, that I lied about how many back surgeries I’ve had, and more. All of those things were completely and totally false, but have simply been ignored at my expense. I don’t know why this shocks me, but it does.', 'Let me share some of my peculiar American story about race, my unwavering love for my mother, and my gratitude for an entire community of people who’ve walked with me through this for my entire life. Just because you are just now learning my story doesn’t make it a secret. Every single person who has known me throughout my life has known most of what I’m sharing here today.', 'When I was 8 years old and in the second grade, black children first began asking me if I was “mixed.” In our house, my white mother, the sweetest woman ever and one of the best friends I’ve ever had, didn’t talk much about race. Most white families don’t. It’s part of the privilege. I didn’t even know what “mixed” was. This isn’t a secret. I’ve told this story publicly in front of thousands of people.', 'After that day when I was first asked if I was mixed, while I was still a very young child, kids and their well-intentioned parents began telling me they knew who my black father was, that I was so and so’s cousin, etc. This was in small-town Versailles, Kentucky, in the 1980s. It happened regularly for years on end. While I didn’t have an understanding of the national dialogue on interracial children, I knew even as a young child that what people were telling meant something very peculiar and unflattering about my mother. I was aware at how different I looked than my siblings, but didn’t understand DNA or genealogy. They were my family and I loved them.', 'I adored my mother so much then, that I just didn’t have the nerve to ever bring these things up to her. I was a child and loved our care-free relationship. She had been married and divorced several times and by the time I was in second grade she was raising my brother and me as a single mom. By the time I reached middle school, I fully identified myself not even as biracial, but just as black. A white classmate of mine from middle school just posted her recollection of this. Of course, that was an oversimplification of my story, but that was what made sense at that time. Adults who loved and knew me, on many occasions sat me down and told me that I was black. As you could imagine, this had a profound impact on me and soon became my truth.', 'Every friend I had was black, my girlfriends were black, I was seen as black, treated as black, and endured constant overt racism as a young black teenager. Never have I once identified myself as white. Not on forms, not for convenience or privilege, and not for fun and games, have I ever identified myself as white. I was never a white guy pretending to be black. Not once, ever, did it occur to me that I was being phony or fraudulent or fake. Quite the opposite — I always believed I was living the truest form of my self.', 'My freshman year in high school, another student and I got into a huge fight at a football game. The fight ended up setting off a powder keg of racial tensions at our school. The school paper back then referred to me as black and him as white. We were suspended for three days and while we were out, racial tensions boiled over so much that hundreds of white students staged a walkout because they had just been banned from wearing Confederate flags.', 'When I returned to school from that suspension, the collective anger of the racist white students was focused on me daily. Dozens of my close friends experienced this racist hate alongside me and it broke us down in the worst ways. I was consistently called nigger, spat on, had a jar of tobacco spit thrown in my face, forced into fights, and on two different occasions chased by pickup trucks attempting to maul us. In 2007, one of the students in one of those trucks wrote me a beautiful, moving apology for calling me a nigger and more on that scary dark night. With his permission, I will republish it soon.', 'In March of 1995, it all boiled over and a racist mob of nearly a dozen students beat me severely, first punching me from all sides, then, when I cradled into a fetal position on the ground they stomped me mercilessly, some with steel-toed boots, for about 20 seconds. That day changed the entire trajectory of my life. Thankfully, multiple credible, unbiased eyewitnesses to this traumatic day have come out publicly and spoken on my behalf in the past 48 hours. Here it is, pasted below as well.', 'The band teacher from Woodfoord County High School, Nathanael Carter, who is a living legend in Versailles, and was the one of the only Black teachers in the school, saw Shea’s account of what happened to me, and posted the following comment in response.', 'A few days after I was assaulted, I was at home recovering when a group of rednecks literally pulled up in my driveway at night, but were chased off by a neighbor with a big flashlight. I had no idea he ever did that. I just remembered them pulling up in our driveway and yard and peeling out. That neighbor just posted his memory of it.', 'I had fractures in my face and ribs, but most badly damaged was my spine. I ended up having three spinal surgeries and missed 20 months of school over it. My entire family endured this deeply painful time in my life ranging from the surgeries, the brutal recovery, physical therapy, and professional counseling. That people are now claiming it never happened is wild to me. It was rougher than my words will ever do justice. My best friend, Willis Polk, who has known me since kindergartern, and is popularly known as the rapper Deacon the Villain from Cunninglynguists, was like a brother to me through these surgeries and all the time I missed. Here’s his account:', 'Many people have said that in the police report it listed me as white — as if I checked the box and that was some deep admission. Today, that officer, Keith Broughton, actually stated that he only checked the white box because biracial wasn’t an option and that he knew I wasn’t white. You have to remember, this wasn’t 2017 — this was 1995 in rural Kentucky. Here’s the quote from the officer who completed the report that Breitbart claims proves I am white.', '“I believe that he’s biracial. I could just tell when I saw him. I marked him white because he’s very light complected. He was there with his white mother. My crime report there’s only two things you can check: black or white. It doesn’t say biracial…anyone from around here who knew him knew he was mixed.”', 'Here is a copy of that police report. Mind you, I didn’t fill this out or review it. I was in the hospital. Everybody in Versailles knew I wasn’t white. He knew it. It wasn’t a secret.', 'For the first time in 20 years I recently spoke with Officer Keith Broughton (who is white). It was a powerfully emotional moment for me. Here’s some of what he said to me in that conversation.', '“Man, when I filled out that I report, and checked that white box, I never thought about it again. I knew you weren’t white, but knew that you weren’t fully black either. I saw your white mother there with you, checked white, and moved on. We have more boxes to choose from now. Of course, none of us had any idea that 20 years later people would be using my report to try to prove something that just isn’t the case. I repeatedly told this to Breitbart when they reached out to me, but they left everything I said to them out of their reports about the story. For instance, I told them specificially that most of your injuries to your spine weren’t visible because of the nature of the injuries, but they reported that I said you weren’t injured. That’s just not what I said.”', 'We sued the school system for years because of their severe mishandling of my assault. They fought it tooth and nail and my mother and I eventually just gave up on it.', 'Rev. Willis Polk, a local pastor, and my best friend’s father, visited and prayed with me often during those surgeries. I became a Christian during my recovery. I was baptized and preached my first sermons as a high school teenage minister in the black church. Rev. Polk, his son Willis, and I toured HBCU’s together in 1996 and we knew that Morehouse College in Atlanta was the only place for us. We loved it.', 'Again, this wasn’t me sneaking into Morehouse as an undercover white man. I was 17 and my racial identity was fully formed. I knew who I was. I wasn’t appropriating or faking, but living out my life. During this entire time, my mother and I had an unspoken understanding about my race. Her past, in a sense, was taboo for me, and I had honestly moved on from even wanting to know the details of who she slept with in January of 1979. I sincerely didn’t care and had compartmentalized it deep in my mind and moved on the best I could.', 'To be clear, I received a full academic and leadership scholarship to attend Morehouse College based on my grades and my leadership skills. I love Morehouse. It helped me heal from the brokenness of my past and my very best friendships and bonds were formed there. Hundreds of students who knew me well at Morehouse have shared their experiences. I wasn’t an obscure student — I was the Student Government President and probably the most visible leader on the campus.', 'When I was forced to leave Morehouse to have yet another spinal surgery, I lost that scholarship and was then offered a scholarship from Oprah Winfrey when I returned to complete my studies. She wanted it to be for “diamonds in the rough” and that was pretty much who I was at that point. I didn’t apply for it. Nobody does. The college selects brothers who need it and I was, very gratefully, chosen for it.', 'Since finishing Morehouse nearly 15 years ago, I have consistently and publicly shared my complicated story as an interracial child, facing the pressures of racism in an environment that lacked little intelligence or compassion about it. A part of this story has always been that I never chose to be black/interracial. Not only was it chosen for me by birth, but white students and staff fundamentally rejected me. Furthermore, the black community, my peers, their parents, and local black leaders, seeing that I was, in essence, a kid without a community, embraced me in the deepest, most soul-soothing ways.', 'My wife, who has been with me since we were both in high school, has walked with me through this every step of the way and shared her story here earlier today. It is pasted below, as well.', 'Outside of my mother’s home, as a kid I lived a deeply black experience. Black families invited me to attend vacation Bible school. I attended black family reunions where old people would come up and pinch my cheeks and tell me who I looked like in their family. I went to black skate parties, black block parties/festivals, and did so not as a white intruder, but as a Karl Kani wearing, widely welcomed, light-skinned black kid. I soaked up every moment I had as I was fully, unabashedly loved, even doted upon, by black families throughout central Kentucky. It was a refuge for me and also a rite of passage of sorts. In high school I joined exclusively black achievers groups. With scholars I love and respect to this day at the University of Kentucky, I attended and helped plan King Day events, and just lived my life.', 'Until this past week, never has anyone asked me who my father was during these 35 years of mine. It occurs to me now that I’ve never asked anyone who their father is either. It’s an odd question, and, in my case, has a complicated, deeply personal answer, but one that I have actually seen lived out many other times. I have walked other people very close to my wife and I through what it is like to find out that the person you believed was your father actually isn’t. This is actually a pretty common thing.', 'I now see pictures of all of our young children, distant relatives, and even people who I am not actually related to spread across the internet in an attempt to shame us somehow. This is disgusting. I want to be clear. I love my family. I have never, not once, hidden or been ashamed of my family. And not a single member of my family has ever spoken out against me. Anyone saying they have is lying. They are my biggest supporters and defenders and always have been. Most of the pictures people have shared to prove that I am white actually came from my own social media accounts that I have shared to hundreds of thousands of people. I’ve never hidden my white family members or pictures from my childhood. They weren’t discovered secretly tucked away in a vault somewhere— I posted them. I love my family. All of them. Again, though, none of us are full blood brothers and sisters. Of course we all look different. Posting pictures that I’ve shared with the world as proof that I am white is just plain dumb.', 'Not one person behind these reports has remotely good intentions — quite the opposite, in fact. Since these articles have been released, my family and I have received constant death threats and nonstop racist harassment. Multiple members of my family have been harassed and we now have been forced to take extra security measures for our safety.', 'This was the goal… divide and conquer. But I will not allow it to define or distract me for one more day and hope that all of you reading this will move on with me. I have promised my wife, kids, extended family, and friends that this will be the last time I talk about this publicly for a long time. My work has never been about me and I’ve never made a big deal about my race. I’ve actually tried hard to avoid ever making a big deal out of it and have, instead, simply tried to do good work that matters. I’m eager to get back to the cause that concerns me most.', 'My focus will continue to be ending police brutality.

And that was where he remained for the next 4 hours.', 'As the hours passed, so did the chants and shouts and screams. He continued to encourage the crowd to scream at the top of their lungs, and chant back to him.', 'I looked around and felt a tad uneasy. “This reminds me of a cult…” a small voice said in the back of my head.', 'I shook it off and tried to get my money’s worth from Robbins’ supposed world-class motivational insights.', 'I ultimately wanted my life to change for the better, just like everyone else in that room.', 'I was willing to look past my discomfort to unlock that possibility.', 'At one point during his talk, while walking the aisles, Robbins stood just a few seats away from me.', 'With my phone out, I looked up at him in awe. He’s a big guy, with an even bigger voice. As he was speaking, there was a moment when we made eye contact. It lasted no more than two seconds, but there was a small voice in my head that said,', '“You should feel lucky, Gillian. Tony Robbins just looked at you. He’s a big deal.”', 'That turned my stomach the moment that thought went through my mind — an hour before, I barely even know who this guy was. Now, I was trying to convince myself that I should feel honoured that he made eye contact with me?', 'What the f*ck was happening to me?', 'But still, I admit that part of my felt special in that moment. So special that I posted the video of the moment we made eye contact on Instagram, and expressed how lucky I felt that Tony Robbins looked at me — why?', 'Because my friend and others around me told me that I should feel lucky.', 'And I believed them.', 'I came home from the trip on an overall positive tone, and gushed to a friend of mine about the conference.', 'After talking about Rachel Hollis, I then described my split-second moment with Tony Robbins.', 'My friend\xa0made\xa0a\xa0face.

Sure— but statistics back up just how reasonable it is to believe survivors from the get-go.', 'Statistically, only 5% of sexual assault allegations are false. That means there’s a 95% likelihood that the accusations will hold truth in them.', 'Furthermore, my belief in victims goes far beyond statistics.', 'There is no gain or 15-minutes of fame in stepping forward with accusations like this. Survivors are dragged through the mud the minute they raise their voices. They are immediately met with suspicion, and their entire identity is picked apart in a cruel display of theatrical misogyny.', 'Survivors who step forward to get justice for the violation against them are retraumatized by society and the justice system for doing so.', 'There is an incredible amount to lose by accusing another of sexual assault — that is exactly why many, just like me, never file a police report against their attacker. Statistics show that 95% of survivors of sexual assault do not report their attack, for a variety of complex and traumatic personal reasons.', 'And that risk is only amplified the more notable and prominent the accused is.', 'Statistically, only 5 out of 1,000 assaulters will be prosecuted and incarcerated for their sexual assault and violation of another human being. The other 995 attackers will walk free.', 'When Harvey Weinstein received 24 years for his crimes, I wept tears of joy. A sentence of that size never happens — especially not to a prominent figure.', 'That was a massive win for the entire survivor community.', 'But there is still plenty of work to be done — especially when we consider 95% of sexual assaults go unreported to begin with.', 'Every survivor has their own reasons\u200a— just as they have valid reasons for not stepping forward.', 'Why did Kavanaugh’s victims step forward to make allegations against him?

My parents were nice to me; I’m not one of those women who’s gravitated toward bad man and after bad man, trapped inside some Greek tragedy of repeating a horrible past while trying to outrun it.

I ran into someone in the Universe with whom I fell so deeply in love that I lost my hold on most aspects of concrete reality. Sure, he was an addict, but that’s only because he was using substances as a stand-in for love — Real Love — the kind he and I had found. And sure, he didn’t seem like that great of a husband his first time around, but that was because it just wasn’t a good fit. And yes, he was prone to dark moods and even unwarranted anger, but none of it was ever about or directed at me (at least not then).', 'I thought love could save him.

I understand, intimately and precisely, how each small command purposefully and inevitably leads to the next step, all of it culminating in a complex functionality that is governed entirely by its own internal logic, regardless of whether that logic operates anywhere else on earth.', 'The problem, I think, is that I’ve been inside The System. The logic did make sense to me, because I’ve been operating within its borders, its batshit-crazy borders. It becomes normal to report every single text message you receive if you do it all the time. It becomes normal to mentally tabulate each second you spend away from home, if you know you’ll be made to account for them the second you cross the threshold. It becomes second nature to bite your tongue before telling him about any small achievement or good thing you’ve experienced because you know he’s just going to say something to trivialize it. It becomes habit to continually remind yourself you’re not crazy if there’s always someone else in the room assuring you that you are.

I felt it bodily: the turn in my stomach, the chill in my skin, the clench in my muscles, bracing for the crash. I felt it viscerally, like a method actor sourcing my own memories. The male boss who told me I was too emotional to do my job well. The white man who publicly shouted down a woman of color in a public meeting, and the other white men who gave him endless second chances. The same men who would later say they were stunned to see the wave of #MeToo posts, and who would profess shock at the casual callousness with which the men of Arrested Development brushed off Jessica Walters’ pain.', 'But somehow, in all that heartache, there was a foothold. The interview went viral, finding its way to women who shared it, and men who were faced with the stark truth of what had too often been their own behavior and the behavior of men they knew. Women wrote think pieces pulling apart Walters’ pain and pointing to the ubiquity of experiences like hers. Tony Hale and Jason Bateman both issued apologies, reflecting on their own behavior and committing to do better in the future.', 'Thanks to centuries’ worth of work from dedicated feminists, most of us could feel misogyny in that painful interview. We could touch the contours of its waves. We could feel its undertows, know where to find them. We could name misogyny publicly as a culprit.', 'Yes, there is pain, both for the woman wronged and for those of us who see ourselves in her experience. But there was acknowledgment, for the first time, of the hurt and harm this kind of abuse causes. And there was a reckoning, not only for Tambor himself, but for the Batemans and Hales of the world, who instinctually and reflexively normalize abuse that falls short of physical or sexual violence. That reckoning doesn’t offer redemption — not by a long shot — but it does show some small measure of progress. For once, we were all grappling with the realities not only of verbal abuse saturated with power dynamics, but of the actions and rationalizations of those who excuse it, and soften the ground for repeat abusers.', 'As a woman who was all too familiar with experiences like Walters’, I felt validated, seen and heard like I hadn’t before. But that validation was, I knew, limited. Because I wasn’t just a woman, I was a fat woman. The bulk of my abuse had come at the hands of thin people, believing they were doing right and doing good, emboldened by a culture that agreed with them. And in my soft and certain marrow, I knew that that abuse — the abuse faced by fat people — would not be understood to warrant a similar reckoning. The same people who chastised Tambor, Bateman, and Hale on social media had readily defended the street harassment and institutional discrimination faced by fat people. And, culturally, they were affirmed.', 'So what do you do when your abuse is widely accepted? And how do you persist when your abuser is a culture?', 'As I write this, I weigh 330 pounds.', 'Three days ago, a stranger sped up to pull alongside my car in traffic. She motioned for me to roll down my window. I did, thinking I might have a tail light out. Instead, I was met with a full-throated shout. GET OUT OF THE CAR AND TRY WALKING FOR A CHANGE.', 'When I got home, I texted a friend to tell her what happened. The response came quickly. Did you do something to provoke her? Cut her off or something? I said no. Nothing? Are you sure? Yes. People are going to judge. I guess the only way to make it stop is to just lose weight.', 'There it was. My own Jason Bateman, with no reflection or reckoning in sight.', 'There is a minefield of abuse reserved for the very fat. Two years ago, I weighed 400 pounds and rode city buses daily. At bus stops, strangers would approach me regularly, insisting on weight loss regimens, telling me loudly what I should and shouldn’t wear, shouting to passersby, is everyone seeing how fat this bitch is? Look at her! On airplanes, strangers stared openly and noisily announced their unwillingness to see my body.', 'I have come to view the world through the prism of that abuse, negotiating my days around reducing it. Who will shout at me? Which doctors will refuse to see me? Which dates will mock my body? Which strangers will photograph me, or make a meme of my skin?', 'These incidents have become commonplace, even rote for me. I have developed a sad skill set: I know how to minimize these instances. I know how to avoid eye contact with strangers, knowing that our locking eyes are too often misconstrued as an invitation to shout or detail their judgments of my body. I know how to deploy a charm offensive, calming agitated aggressors before they get the chance to unleash their fury. I know how to swallow these instances, feel their pressure only from within myself. I know how to keep abusers at bay alone, knowing that no one else will step in. I know how to contain the blast.', 'But the most difficult part of anti-fat attitudes isn’t bullying, harassment, fear or violence. It is the sudden glut of defenders that suddenly materialize when I name those experiences. When it comes to fat hate, nearly anyone can be a Jason Bateman or a Tony Hale, eagerly normalizing and excusing abusive behavior.', 'I have come to expect epithets and aggression, have come to weather their heat and pressure. But I have never become accustomed to the complete lack of empathy from so many around me. I refuse to accept it.', 'As I listened to Jessica Walter’s tearful words, I thought of our similarities, the sad and unjust overlap in the Venn diagram of our otherwise disparate lives. But as the public response unfolded, replete with sympathetic heartbreak and righteous outrage, I found myself thinking more and more about our differences.', 'For women — especially white women — describing our abuse is difficult, but increasingly, it’s met by some measure of sympathy, even if only from other women. But when fat people disclose our abuse, we are met with a steely refusal to believe it.', 'Nearly everyone defends abusers of fat people. My friend — an avowed feminist — seemed certain I must have done something to aggravate the driver of that passing car. Despite her bone-deep values, she suddenly searched for the wrongdoing in the bullied, not the bully. Even her final response insistently normalized that abuse. The only way to stop it is to just lose weight.', 'When that abuse turns physical, those scraps of empathy dissolve altogether. Fat survivors are told we are so undesirable that it’s impossible to sexually assault us. When it turns institutional, as with staggeringly prevalent employment discrimination or punitive airline policies, others’ responses curdle, turning from indifference to outright defense. Suddenly, people who otherwise relish complaining about delayed flights and cramped legroom become airlines’ staunchest defenders. They’ve got to make their money. Like spokespeople, they pivot to profits and regulation, the cost of jet fuel and supply side economics, defending companies they otherwise regularly decry.', 'It gets disappointing, seeing how quickly even those who love you can forget your humanity, explain away your abuse. But more than that, it gets lonely.', 'There are so many barriers to empathizing with fat people. Many will overconfidently assert that fat people are in full control of our own bodies, despite a growing body of evidence to the contrary. Fat people are readily, gleefully mocked in movies, or held up as tragic morality tales on TV. When fat people are depicted with anything approaching normalcy, we’re met with naked disgust. Disdain for fat people is even encouraged, reframed as tough love, somehow deployed to our benefit (again, despite the proof that it often only makes us fatter).', 'Yes, there are barriers to empathizing with fat people. But it shouldn’t be an act of courageous defiance to name what fat people face as abuse. It shouldn’t be a radical act to insist that no one’s body warrants beratement simply by passing through someone else’s field of view.', 'I understand why others don’t intervene when fat hate rears its head. Intervention is uncomfortable and uncertain, risky and difficult. We don’t know what to say or how to make it stop. We find ourselves out of our depth, reaching for skillsets we’ve never had to develop, or suddenly reliving our own abuse. I can still recall vividly the times I have frozen in the face of abuse, or the times that I have failed to recognize it with the seriousness it deserved.', 'But all of that assumes we already see fat people’s experiences as abusive, and that we recognize it as something that’s wrong. But at our core, even without intending to, most of us believe that abuse of fat people is simply a natural consequence of living in such defiant bodies. We believe that fat people can change our bodies, we simply fail to. We believe that “tough love” will motivate that change. And we believe that fat hate ought not earn our outrage because it is simply the way of the world, unworthy of the effort it would require to change it.', 'Yes, I long for intervention in fat hate when it happens. But more than that, I am desperate for simple acknowledgement. I yearn for a that should never happen to anyone, offered without caveats or limitations, “tough love” posturing or threats of my assumed impending illness.', 'If you don’t wear plus sizes, you may struggle to hear the severity and irrationality of anti-fat abuse and bias. It may be difficult to hear, or difficult to believe. It speaks to a world that may be unfathomable to you. Life in a thinner body means the world around you has been redacted, presented to you only in part. It is unthinkable that strangers shout unprompted epithets at my body, but they do. It is unfathomable that doctors ban fat patients from their offices, but they do. It is impossible that airlines would bend to the will of brash and finicky passengers, but they do.', 'Like those mystified men, Bateman and Hale before you, you cannot see the air you’ve been breathing for years, cannot touch the shifting ground beneath your feet. Fat abuse has become invisible to you, a natural law. To many thin people, objecting to fat hate is as irrational as objecting to gravity. Why waste outrage on a simple fact of the world we live in? You have passively accepted it, because that is the only option that has been presented to you.', 'The greek chorus of Batemans and Hales in my life, when faced with the ubiquitous sharp edges of fat hate, have too readily insisted that you can’t change the world, you can only change yourself, by which they mean me.', 'I am asking you to try to change your own perception, and in so doing, make some small change to the world.', 'I am asking you to reach out, feel the world around you as it exists now. Experience it anew. You cannot see the air, the way it pushes in gales of wind. But you can look to the trees. You can see how they sway and break when its momentum becomes too great.', 'I am asking you sharpen your vision if only so you can see me. I am asking you to notice when I am swept up, broken, gone.', 'Liked this piece? There are more like it. You can also find Your Fat Friend on Twitter and Facebook.']"

My husband was one of each.', 'When his dark side was in control, he was abusive; there is no disputing this. He would scream at me, threaten me, call me names; he monitored my phone and laptop; he isolated me; he lied, he stole, and he drank until his face twisted into a sneer and his normally soft-spoken voice curdled into a vicious snarl.', 'That’s part of the story.', 'The other part is the love. The other part contains the chapters in which he and I talk about nothing, about everything, for hours on end. It contains the chapters in which we make love, in a way I never had before and probably never will again. It wasn’t just that he was skilled and giving in bed — it’s that he was kind. It’s that he made me feel safe and accepted in a way I did not know was possible.', 'Domestic abuse incubates in the cradle, in what’s supposed to be the safest and softest place.

It contains the chapter in which he sits quietly next to a homeless woman to protect her from men on the street who were harassing her.', 'When the danger had passed and I gestured that we needed to keep moving — we had a plane to catch — the woman cried and clung to him. It broke my heart, because I knew how she felt. I never wanted to let go of him either.', 'When, several years into our relationship, his dark side began to appear, it was terrifying in its intensity and abruptness. It was not like living with one person who had a variety of moods; it was like there were suddenly two of him — two entirely different and opposite characters whom I never saw in the same place at the same time. It was literally unnerving. My nerves were coming apart, bifurcating beneath my skin.', 'Domestic abuse is perhaps the most insidious of crimes, because it incubates in the cradle, in what’s supposed to be the safest and softest place.

I turned myself inside out for this person, exposed every chink, every scar, every raw place, and every bruise. I said, Here, you can have everything. I trust you. How had I been so wrong? Had I just been tricked? How could I be so tricked for so long? It seemed impossible.', 'And yet it was real. He was Jekyll and Hyde, my best friend and my worst enemy. I kept trying to reconcile everything. I could not accept that the good him would not prevail in the end. I honestly believed love could chase away the darkness so the so-called real man — the best-friend-Jekyll — would come back and stay. I thought that if I sat with him, just as he’d sat with the mentally ill homeless woman, that the taunting and the terrorizing would eventually give up and leave.', 'But it didn’t. It just got worse. Eventually, I could barely find Jekyll. I would just see fleeting glimpses of him pass over the face I almost didn’t recognize anymore. I once saw a single tear slide down his cheek while he watched a news story about a young girl who jumped off the roof of her college dorm. The girl had long black hair, and she looked like his daughter from his first marriage.', 'By the time I left, literally in the dark of night, I was spending all my days on the lower rungs of Maslow’s Hierarchy, clamoring for shelter and safety, too scared and scattered to engage my intellect in any sort of productive way.', 'Now that we’re out — now that my girls and I are safely settled in a new place whose location he doesn’t know — I am questioning everything.

https://medium.com/humane-tech/the-immortal-myths-about-online-abuse-a156e3370aee?source=search_post---------4,Abuse,62.txt,1318,1,"['Yes, you can. Most small communities on the web don’t have major problems with abuse, because they are well managed and well moderated. But the majority of marginalized people endure abuse online because the bigger social networks and media platforms are so bad at preventing abuse that it’s become part of the everyday online experience for millions of people. The good news is, the same principles that allow small sites to run well can be applied to even the largest sites, with proper investment. It simply takes the appropriate amount of time, resources, and experience being applied to the problem.', 'Because the vast majority of online abuse is directed at underrepresented people who are women, people of color, and/or members of other marginalized groups, the net effect of online abuse is to silence members of these communities. Allowing abuse hurts free speech. Communities that allow abusers to dominate conversation don’t just silence marginalized people, they also drive away any reasonable or thoughtful person who’s put off by that hostile environment. Common sense tells us that more people will feel free to express themselves in an environment where threats, abuse, harassment, or attacks aren’t dominating the conversation.', 'Unfortunately, the technology behind social networks doesn’t work that way. The same action in an app can be harmless or destructive, depending on the context in which it’s done and the power and social standing of the people on either end. For example, software might be able to detect if someone has posted a person’s legal name, but software can’t easily tell if a community was identifying someone who had been harassing or mistreating others or because a community wanted to name a person in order to harass them. One is accountability, the other is abuse, and almost no organization can afford to develop software sophisticated enough to make that distinction. Of course, a human could usually understand this distinction in moments, but that requires a human to be assigned to do so. Unfortunately, since most online platforms are made by people who love technology, they tend to want to try to think of technology as the solution to this definitively human problem.', 'The vast majority of online abuse goes unreported; most users will only report an action if it’s extremely egregious, part of an ongoing or large-scale campaign, or presents a particularly urgent danger. Despite how reluctant targets are to actually report abuse, the reaction when they do so is often skepticism or denial from people who aren’t the target of online abuse. These skeptics see the other, less-harmful messages that are merely critical or insulting and think that the targeted person is overreacting to messages that are merely annoying. This is especially true because social platforms will hide a potentially threatening or harmful message while they investigate reports of abuse. The net result? Skeptics only see messages that weren’t worthy of being reported, and they use that to justify doubting reports. This is especially true because many of the worst abusers online know how to shift from one medium to another, meaning a campaign that starts on one platform can lead to abuse on a different platform, making the full context of the abuse hard to recognize.', 'One of the most common reflexive solutions to abuse is to call for the use of “real names”. This is usually from people with little experience in managing large-scale online communities. Those who do run such systems can attest that an enormous amount of abuse is caused by people who are acting under their legal names; this is possible because many abusive behaviors can be extremely destructive without actually being illegal. (See #7.) For dedicated trolls, it’s also usually not very hard to create a name that seems “real”, which they can use for their attacks. For vulnerable people, using one’s legal name can make them targets for stalkers or others they are trying to avoid, or can force people to retain an identity that is no longer theirs. Worse, even if a user does want to use their legal name on a service, it can be almost impossible to capture someone’s real name in most common social apps. While persistent identities (pseudonyms) can be a useful tool for making a more accountable community when appropriate, legal names do very little to reduce abuse in large scale communities.', 'Charging people to participate doesn’t stop abuse, it just limits your community to only people with extra disposable income, curtailing the expression of well-intentioned people who don’t have extra money lying around. There are plenty of people who perform abusive behaviors online who will spend money to do so; they’re often already investing an enormous amount of time in their antisocial behaviors, so a small fee doesn’t act as much of a deterrence. And even if you set an inordinately high fee, we now have millionaires knowingly leading communities of abusers and harassers online in many of the worst communities — they won’t be deterred by fees.', 'As discussed in “What is Public?”, there are lots of behaviors — even including some kinds of doxing — that aren’t illegal (or whose legality is unclear) but that can have life-ruining effects on victims. Even when actions are clearly illegal, very few law enforcement organizations take online abuse seriously, or have staff trained in how to help fight it. Making a case to law enforcement requires victims to spend enormous amounts of time and money documenting the abuse that they’ve endured, usually to very little effect. And as has been amply documented, remedies that rely on law enforcement demonstrate all the problems that we see in offline interactions with law enforcement, including an overwhelmingly ineffective track record in actually reducing abuse or prosecuting abusers.', 'Perhaps the most pervasive myth amongst people creating communities online is the idea that addressing abuse is a matter of simply fixing a few technological bugs. Abuse, harassment, threats, and attacks are both common issues and ever-evolving problems to be solved. Yet, unlike systemic issues like service downtime or content creation, most of the technology and media companies that host communities online refuse to assign proper resources to keeping their community healthy. Depending on the size of the community, it requires people who have specifically been tasked with moderating a community, staying up to date on larger social and cultural issues that drive abuse, and learning from other communities about what threats they face. This of course has to be matched with the appropriate technological resources to build systems to protect and empower targets or potential targets.', 'The bottom line, as I wrote half a decade ago, is that if your website is full of assholes, it’s your fault. Same goes for your apps. We are accountable for the communities we create, and if we want to take credit for the magical moments that happen when people connect with each other online, then we have to take responsibility for the negative experiences that we enable.', 'Our communities are defined by the worst things that we permit to happen. What we allow tells the world who we are.', 'After so many years and so many conversations about this problem, it’s frustrating to think that these basic fallacies keep creeping back into the conversation. Sometimes it’s from those who would seek to enable abuse; obviously, we can safely dismiss the people who support awful behaviors online. But at times, we hear these arguments from otherwise-reasonable people who simply are uninformed about the lessons we’ve learned over the past 20 years.', 'Too often, decisions about our online communities are being made by those who aren’t familiar with the discussion that’s come before. Perhaps if we can ensure that the well-intentioned aren’t repeating the hoariest and least accurate clichés that stand in the way of addressing abuse online, we can finally make some real progress.', 'I’m the cofounder of Makerbase, a community for people who make apps and websites.

Johnson', 'Childhood is a crucial time and one in which we form our defining ideas on everything from romantic love to happiness. The relationships we share with our parents are important, but they can be damaging too. When you’re the adult child of an emotionally abusive parent, the road is hardly ever a straight one. It’s up to you to find healing, though, and it’s up to you to let in the light of happiness and truth.', 'Though we aren’t responsible for the complex damage done to us by emotionally abusive or neglectful parents, we are responsible for healing that damage in our adult lives so we can find happiness for ourselves. That comes with a big dose of brutal self-acceptance, however, and committing to undoing the damage that’s been years in the making. We can find joy after waking up from an emotionally abusive childhood, but only when we accept both who we are and who we want to be.', 'Our childhood memories often seem to be tinged with a touch of rose-tinted nostalgia. When you think of your childhood amid a stressed adulthood, you’re inclined to remember surprise Santa Claus visits or happy days on the playground with friends. What about the hard stuff, though? What about those tough-to-swallow memories that make us squirm, or otherwise defined who we are?', 'Emotional neglect occurs when our caretakers fail to appropriately respond to our emotional needs at critical stages in our development. While child abuse is a very intentional act, emotional neglect generally occurs out of ignorance or as the result of an extreme form of narcissism.It’s a failure to act and respond to a child’s emotional needs, and it’s an unwillingness to do the emotional work it takes to be an adequate parent.', 'Because emotional neglect is so subtle, many of us fail to recognize its consequences in our lives until we are well into our adulthood. Overcoming the effects of emotional neglect is a long process, and it takes a certain amount of brutal honestly, applied self-compassion and understanding. Getting ourselves back to true happiness and peace takes learning how to correct these flaws and start loving ourselves for who we are.', 'Emotional abuse isn’t just screaming and stomping around. There are very different facets to childhood emotional abuse. From a reject of needs, to corrupting our sense of right and wrong — these are the 5 facets of childhood abuse which could indicate you were abused or neglected emotionally.', 'An emotionally abusive parent is one who dismisses the emotional needs of their child, or otherwise refuses to show affection. This might occur by withholding affection when the child is perceived to have done something “wrong” or it may occur outright — by treating the child with cold and distant disdain. The caretaker here is denying the child the affection it needs to thrive or feel secure, thus inflicting deep and long-lasting trauma that can make it hard for those children to have happy and balanced relationships in future.', 'One of the hallmark signs of abuse is, without question, isolation. Abusers isolate their victims because it limits the chances of discovery, and also allows them to exert greater control over those relationships. An emotionally abusive parent might refuse to allow their child to take place in normal activities, or they might (once again) use isolation as a heavy-handed means of “punishment” though it is ultimately more about control and inflicting distress.', 'Terror doesn’t occur only in the home of the child who receives regularly beatings — it’s a foundation of emotional abuse too. Parents and caretakers terrorize their children with the promise of severe punishments, or the threat of something far more sinister which can cause them to hide or fear opening up. This constant terror creates a climate of threat, which with it erodes all sense of trust and safety the child has in their home and their caretakers.', 'Emotional abuse doesn’t just come with terror and threats. It can include dismissal and emotional neglect as well. When a parent goes out of their way to ignore the needs of their child, or if they are suffering from untreated mental illness, it can leave the child with a sense of being unwanted and unconsidered. Children need validation because that validation guides them toward future social skills, abilities and understandings. when they are denied that by their caretakers, it can lead to major emotional upsets later on.', 'Perhaps the most insidious aspect of emotional abuse is that of emotional and social corruption. This form of abuse takes place when the parent or caretaker encourages their offspring to engage in malicious or antisocial behavior. They might do this directly, or they might do this by responding to the child only when they are in an extreme or unpleasant emotional state. Only receiving the attention that you need when you’re acting up, hurting yourself, or hurting others leads to the development of false values and even damaging behavioral patterns.', 'Unlike physical abuse, the scars of emotional abuse run deep and often far beneath the places we are comfortable lurking. Because emotional abuse requires us to bury our pain and our experiences deep, and dismiss our base instincts, it can be hard for us to recognize and accept that we were childhood victims of emotional abuse.', 'As adults, we have a toxic way at looking back at the needs of our childhood as “trivial” or not that important. More often than not, we brush-off the deep feelings of hurt, loss and rejection as common misunderstandings of childhood, rather than the definitive and scary moments they truly are. Dismissing these needs only further buries them in our subconscious. The longer this goes on, the more serious the side-effects can become.', 'Normalization is one of the most common (and understandable) reasons that we struggle to resolve — or even accept — our childhood emotional trauma. This occurs when we accept the idea that our experience is common, and therefore invalid. Because everyone has this experience, we start to believe that it doesn’t matter very much. Nothing could be further from the truth, however. Just because something is common does not make it any less traumatic or damaging to who you are.', 'Children have an uncanny way of internalizing the bad things that happen to them, and that’s especially true when it comes to emotional abuse. When we internalize our trauma, we start to believe that the poor treatment we received as children is our fault. It’s my fault, we tell ourselves. Anything my parents did to me was because I deserved it. It happened because I wasn’t good enough. Internalizing your trauma can cause you to turn away from it, and accept it as an inevitable part of your insecurities.', 'At one point in time, you might have known your trauma and named it for what it was. Things change, though, and the bonds we share with our families have a big part to play. You may know that it’s wrong, but the familial ties you share with your abusers leads to a shamed sense of silence, or otherwise convinces you to bury away your trauma and pretend that it never happened. The longer you allow yourself to be shamed into silence, the further you are pulled into shadow.', 'Emotional abuse can be subtle and, likewise, the symptoms we exhibit can take a long time to manifest and impact our happiness. Having an inability to rely on others, or an over-the-top inner-critic that blames you for everything isn’t normal. It’s more commonly a sign that you’re living with the idea that you’re unloveable. An erroneous idea that was implanted in your head by a parent that didn’t live up to their responsibilities to you.', 'Adult children of emotional abuse often find themselves struggling with self-esteem later on in life. Whether they learned to feel unworthy of love, or they learned that they weren’t smart enough, or pretty enough, or successful enough — the way we bond and interact with our parents plays a critical role in every facet of our adult life. Holding onto the emotional traumas you share with your caretakers leads to a perpetuation of those negative and self-limiting beliefs, and forces us to accept the belief that we aren’t good enough or that we deserve to be treated poorly.', 'Because emotional abusers are so skilled at making the victim feel at fault, those victims can also find themselves struggling with a constant and permeating sense of guilt. This constant guilt can cause you to act out, lean into addictive or risky behaviors, or even deny yourself the opportunities that would otherwise allow you to thrive and reach your dreams. It’s important to remember that, as a child, you were totally innocent. It is up to your parents to care for us, and provide us the emotional stability and affection we need.', 'If your parents constantly snooped on you, or exposed your private information to people you didn’t trust (or didn’t wish to share that information with), it can lead a hyper-sense of violation that follows us through life. Because you never felt as though you had a sense of privacy, you might become an overly private or walled-off person in your adult life. Burying all your important thoughts, emotions and vulnerabilities down deep — you might find it hard to connect with others on an authentic level.', 'Broken relationships with our parents equals broken relationships with our partners, friends and even our own children later on in life. This comes down to the attachment styles we learn from our parents; as well as any other directly or indirectly instilled fears and insecurities like fear of abandonment. The adult child of an emotionally abusive household might find themselves in emotionally abusive romantic relationships, filled with blowups and lots of drama. It comes down to learning how to reshape the way we react and emote.', 'It’s hard to retain a positive outlook, when you spend your childhood having your feelings dismissed or demeaned. Adults who were raised under the shadow of emotional abuse might find that their inner critic reigns supreme, and they may struggle to see anyone and anything in a positive light. Because their baselines were formed in the midst of terror, isolation and even abandon — it can be easier for them to expect the worst. It’s a coping mechanism, and one that’s meant to protect them from continued emotional harm (although, it does more damage in the long-term).', 'When you’re emotionally abused, you learn that it isn’t safe for you to express your emotions. As a child, when you expressed your emotions they were probably dismissed or they may have even caused anger in your parent or caretaker. As an adult, this can lead to burying your hard or unpleasant emotions away; leaving them to fester and further manifest through subconscious patterns of behavior and reaction.', 'If you’re struggling with the fallout of emotional abuse as an adult, you can find peace but it takes a lot of hard work. Not all emotional abuse is created equal. Some hurts run deep and require the help of a mental health professional to overcome. For everything else, however, we are the only life raft that there is. If you’re struggling to find love in your lifeyou have to learn how to love yourself, and let go of the things your parents couldn’t give you.', 'The first step in recovering from the emotional abuse in your childhood is to get honest about what went wrong. This means accepting what happened, and accepting your parents and caretakers for the mistakes that they made. You have to let go of the internalized guilt and understand that — as a child — you were not at fault for the pain in your past. Get honest about what went wrong and use that knowledge to create a plan moving forward.', 'Start small, and ease into the waters of acceptance with a gentle journalling or meditation practice. Find a space where you can think uninterrupted, and put yourself back in a time when you felt that your parent didn’t listen to you, or didn’t respond to your emotional needs. Watch the scene replay as though you were distantly removed.', 'How did your parent react to you? How did that make you respond? Consider that child as if it were your own, and let those emotions come back to you as if you were back in that moment. Understand that your parents were human, with all the complex and flawed emotions and experiences that you have to. Use that understanding to cultivate an acceptance of what happened to you, so you can figure out how to fix it. As you get more comfortable looking back into your past, lean into the big things. Don’t be afraid to shy away from the truth…no matter how much that might hurt.', 'If you don’t carve out the mental space you need to detach from who and what was, you won’t be able to break free of the shackles your family past has over you. Emotionally toxic or damaging childhoods never go away. They follow us, manifesting again and again in a number of different manners that undermine our overall mental and emotional health. We have to set boundaries in order to let the healing process come full circle.', 'Have enough respect for yourself to set boundaries with those who injure you more than they lift you up. Do whatever you need to do to protect yourself, and honor your worth by letting others know what you will and will not tolerate. If the emotionally distant parent is still in your life, communicate your needs to them and let them know that those needs take priority in your life.', 'Embrace the emotions that make you uncomfortable and recognize the people and the triggers that bring out the best in you and your psyche.Learning to love ourselves takes time and effort, but know our worth isn’t difficult. As a human alive on this earth, you’re worth all the happiness, love and effort in the world. Only you can allow someone else to deny you that. When you start to recognize this, you’re on the path to being whole again.', 'Growing up in a household that is devoid of the right emotional connection can make it hard for you to recognize your emotions, and even harder for you to manage them.More often than not, our caretakers distance themselves emotionally because they don’t know how to deal with their own emotions. Only by learning how to confront our emotions can we deal with them efficiently and get back to the happiness we deserve.', 'When we find ourselves in a stressful event, we often feel a flood of emotions all at once which makes it hard to process and orientate ourselves. Though we are often told the best way to deal with these emotions is to ignore them, we actually gain more benefits by learning how to identify each emotion as its experiences in a technique that’s known as emotional differentiation.', 'Differentiation stops negative emotions from getting worse by building up our confidence in facing them. It allows us to identify what we’re feeling and (eventually) why we’re feeling that way, which leads to true resolution and clarity and, thus, higher levels of happiness and contentment. When we learn how to see our emotions for what they are — and where they come from — we can accept them and then get better at managing them. It’s like being a manager in a restaurant. If you really want to be effective, you have to get to know your staff and figure out what works best for everyone.', 'Facing and resolving the emotional neglect in our pasts is not something that we can always do alone and it’s not something that can be managed simply with the help of a few good friends. Sometimes, it’s necessary to find a specialist when dealing with childhood neglect of every kind; but it’s important to make sure you’re finding the right person to help you resolve past issues.', 'Trauma symptoms vary from case to case and as such need to be assess by qualified and experienced trauma professionals. Finding a therapist who has experience treating trauma like yours can take time, but cognitive-behavioral therapists and EMDR professionals are a good place to start. Take your time and don’t rush into anything that doesn’t feel right.', 'A professional can help you get to the root of your problems, but you need to be ready to open up and need to know what direction you want to head in. Healing is hard but living eternally in pain is harder. If you think you need more serious help, reach out for it. When you feel better physically, you have more strength to engage in the mental and emotional war of healing and resolution. This puts our overall wellness in clearer focus and makes our efforts to heal more effective and less costly in the long run.', 'The act of applied self-compassion is a powerful tool in recovering from the pain caused by emotionally neglectful parents. Self-compassion is not self-kindness and it’s not self-pity either. It’s taking an active role in your own healing, and it involves embracing your faults, mistakes and suffering as equally you celebrate your joys, successes and triumphs.When we utilize real self-compassion in our lives, we extend the same kindness, caring and understanding to ourselves as we would to a friend or a loved one.', 'According to Dr. Kristin Neff, a master in self-compassion research, there are 3 core components to true and realized self-compassion. More than just being nice to yourself, you also have to dig deep into your common humanity and become mindful of the way you both react and interact with your real, internal self. Self-compassion is a powerful tool, when we know how to wield it, but it takes a big commitment and it takes a lot of work each day to build. Adding it to our lives means finding happiness, however, and discovering that true beauty and joy is one of the most beautiful gifts we can give ourselves.', 'Look at things from the perspective of your inner child. Are you finally standing up for the little boy or little girl and protecting them, the way they should have been protected all those years ago? Be mindful of yourself, and be mindful of your needs (both emotional and physical). Let go of your need to be perfect for anyone, and instead on becoming the best version of yourself, for yourself.If there’s something you don’t like about yourself — make a plan to change it — but only after looking it boldly in the face and accepting it for what it is. Spend a few minutes each day practicing this, and use it to get beyond the pain of your estrangement.', 'Gratitude is one of the best ways we can deal with our negative emotions. It doesn’t matter who you are, or whether you’re surrounded by a million people you love or not. If you’re a living human being — you have something to be grateful for. Big or small, there are beautiful things all around us that have the ability to give our lives meaning, or remind us of the good things that are just within our reach.', 'Take 5 minutes to sit down each day and make a list of all the things in your life that you’re grateful for. List the great things in your life and the things that make you smile. Read through the list a few times and make sure not to forget the simple things.', 'You’ll start to really connect with yourself and your emotions when you begin to remember that it’s not all doom and gloom. There’s something out there for everyone to love in life and if you haven’t found that yet it’s time to get started. The greatest thing about happiness is that it is not a luxury commodity — it’s a state of being that exists, naturally, within each and every one of us. You don’t need your parents or your siblings or anyone else to be happy. That’s something that can only be generated from within and shared without.', 'When we are hurt by our parents, we often go out looking for healing in all the wrong places. We turn to other people, to drugs, to alcohol — all in the search of the love we were denied when we needed it most. Not being taught how to properly manage our emotions (the good and the bad) can result in associating happiness with the feeling of pleasure, when that’s not necessarily true. There is no salvation in pleasure alone. The problem with that is that no one else can save us. Only we can save ourselves.', 'Sometimes, you have to step up and be the parent you always deserved for yourself. This means treating yourself well, checking in how you’re feeling and how you’re doing. Be a mentor for yourself; an advocate for yourself. Do all the things a caring mother or father would do and do it with complete radical abandon. Find activities that bring you peace and joy and be kind and gentle with yourself and the way you see the world.', 'Work hard to build up that confidence that was wrecked by a dismissive or emotionally distant parent and celebrate your strengths and victories every single day.Write notes to yourself and start a mindful journaling practice that lets you get back in touch with that scared, broken little child that’s hiding deep inside. Learn how to love yourself and the rest of the world will follow. Give yourself a gift that never quits giving and be the parent you always needed.', 'Substituting our unhealthy family relationships for the ones that better suit our lifestyles and emotional needs is a good way to cut ties and find your way back to healing. It can be helpful to allow your attention to center on the healthy relationships that bring joy into your life, rather than the ones that attract nothing but negativity. There is no law that says family is blood and blood alone. You can choose your family, and you can choose people who provide emotional fulfillment.', 'Get comfortable talking about how you feel, and find a friend you can trust that is willing to listen to you vent. Let them know exactly how your childhood or upbringing is still causing you to struggle and let them know you need a willing shoulder (and a willing ear) to listen to you work things out on a regular basis. Always make sure, however, that you have their consent before unloading. Not everyone has the ability toprocess our emotions and experiences in the same way. Even if we can trust them not to spread our business.', 'The family and chosen family we surround ourselves is important, and can be especially important when it comes tocreating the lives we want. If you’re struggling to let go of a toxic or emotionally damaging family member, re-establishing abandoned ties with your own outside support networks can be a great way to get back in contact with whoyou are. This is because our relationships allow us to get a better grip in our perspective. And that makes all the difference when it comes to fulfillment and joy.', 'There are a number of ways in which our parents can emotionally wound or scar us, all of them resulting in deep-seated pain that can cause serious problems in our adolescent and adult lives. When we fail to recognize and deal with this pain, it follows us, and can lead to a lot of negative side effects and coping mechanisms that eat way at who we are and the future we’re trying to build for ourselves. If we want to heal, we have to dig deep. And get focused on our needs and fulfilling them with honesty and compassion.', 'Get in touch with your past and start embracing those experiences for what they are — the good and the bad. Dig deep and realize that you have every right to feel how you feel. Our emotions don’t come from nowhere. They are a reaction to the stimuli in our environment. Be honest about your needs and reach out to a professional for further resolution if needed. Gratitude and compassion are two of the greatest gifts we can give ourselves when we’re trying to recover from a childhood that was lacking in affection and emotional connection. Give yourself a second childhood and become the parent you never had. Fall in love with your strengths and recognize that you empower yourself through your weaknesses. Find people you trust and gather them closely. When we open up to our support networks, we can unlock powerful healing we didn’t even know was possible. Sort out your boundaries and use them to boost yourself into an emotionally empowered future. The shackles of your childhood don’t have to be the prison of your future. Let go and find the healing you’re seeking yourself.', 'medium.com']"

You are not alone. There are millions of men around the country looking at their past behavior and wondering what they can and should do about it. You can help them follow the right path by taking the first steps yourself. This is not easy. This open accountability for the wrongs you’ve done is very painful to go through.

Objects that are in motion, tend to be in motion.', 'One of the most difficult things about overcoming narcissistic abuse is shifting the dynamic from dwelling in pain and ruminating on the past to gaining momentum that will launch us into a brighter future.', 'The pain is a natural response to the abuse, which broke our heart and in most cases destroyed our sense of self. So we are dealing with a lot.', 'The cognitive dissonance of two clashing ideas — one being the narcissist as our soul-mate, and the other our ex as a heartless oppressor — is at the root of massive confusion that is left over after the relationship falls apart. Many people that I speak to in my coaching practice, express an attitude of disbelief. How could she or he have done all these things? I thought they loved me!', 'It is important to remember that narcissists, borderlines, psychopaths, sociopaths, histrionics and any combination thereof, are not people who go from being normal only to switch into the disorder in moments of pressure of stress. It is called a personality disorder for a reason. This is who they are and how they are all the time.', 'Many partners of Cluster Bs are notorious at projecting their values and perceptions onto their disordered partner. Our traits of empathy, compassion and forgiveness run deep and make us question the motives behind the narcissist’s horrendous acts. So we give them benefits of the doubt. Over and over and over again, in essence enabling the abuse to continue and even escalate. Instead of resolving anything, our kindness coupled with rationalization of their behavior keeps the abuse cycle going.', 'So we finally awaken to the harsh truth and get away. Now what? Now the true healing begins. Initially it will feel like trying to climb a muddy mountain. We keep slipping and end up exhausted getting nowhere. But it only seems this way.', 'Each time we do a kind act towards ourselves, it adds up. The body and mind indeed do keep a score.', 'Eventually my small self-care practices began to gain momentum until months later I reached the tipping point. Eight months later I’m no longer pulled into the downward spiral of despair. Instead, what happened fuels my desire to be even kinder to myself, and to spread this information to others who are suffering with the mission to provide relief and understanding.', 'Below are the ten practices that I incorporated into my healing practice that helped me to overcome the devastation caused my narcissistic abuse.', 'In order for the healing to commence, you need to put a protective shield around yourself. If you can physically get away, that is the best. Any memory of the narcissist will keep triggering the pain, slowing down your recovery. So, block them on your phone, email, all your social media, etc. Get rid of any memorabilia reminding you of them. And for goodness sake, do not stalk their profiles!', 'If you are unable to physically remove yourself from their environment, look into a technique called ‘grey rock.’ The ideas is that while you interact with the narc, you remain emotionally and mentally disengaged, giving them nothing to feed on. Even though you may be boiling inside, do not let them see that. Once you are alone, let it all out. Cry, scream, cuss. Whatever brings you relief.', 'Another form of a boundary to start practicing is learning how to say no. It will help you build self-respect and true confidence. Your boundary is like a cell wall. It keeps nutrients in and toxicity out. Become very picky whom you let in.', 'During the time you’ve spent around the narcissist doing everything in your power to please and appease them, you’ve been exposed to a serious mental disorder. It is extremely unhealthy to the mind of an empath. We took it in by doing what we could to ‘understand’ them and walk in their shoes. Narcissists know this and take full advantage of this empathic trait.', 'Now it is time to let all that dark goo out for health and clarity to be restored. One of the best things you can do is externalize it. Journal about what happened, talk to a trusted friend who ‘gets it,’ engage a therapist or a coach. Join a support group to connect with others who can relate to your experience. Externalizing will help chaotic, confused thoughts click into place restoring a semblance of order. It will help clear your slate from the debris.', 'Other forms of externalization include movement, such as dance, deep breathing, mind-body exercises like yoga, sweating, getting a massage. All this is helpful in metabolizing the toxic chemicals that have been generated during the devaluation and discard stages of the relationship.', 'This step will begin to set your mind straight. You must accept the truth that this person was highly toxic and consciously hurt you. Realize you’ve been tricked, manipulated and abused! Your high pain threshold worked to your disadvantage, making them push you farther and farther with each abuse cycle. Seeing them as a reflection of you, obscured the warning signs and made them fly under your radar. Your best traits were used against you: empathy, desire to explore, openness, positive sociability, etc. (For more in-depth exploration of this topic, check out my video ‘8 reasons you fell into the narc trap.’) And finally, not realizing you were in a dirty game, you were outmaneuvered.', 'It was not your fault. Forgive yourself.', 'But you disregarded it. This is a step where we begin to take responsibility (not to be confused with self-blame!) and do a rational post-mortem analysis of what happened.', 'Maybe you got a feeling in your stomach at some point early in the relationship. Maybe some things they said just didn’t add up. Look at that and ask yourself why you disregarded your intuitive hints. Was it because you really wanted to make it work? Was it because their words of admiration and acts of ‘love’ filled that void inside your soul, a void left over perhaps from childhood?', 'If you’ve never truly felt loved in your life, especially by your parents, it is very normal for you to seek a fulfillment of that love in your adult life. However, it is a huge vulnerability. Especially in the vicinity of a predator who can smell that love wound on you and be attracted to it the was a shark is attracted by the scent of blood.', 'Your intuition is your friend. The more you listen to it, the stronger it will get. It may be really difficult to connect with your intuition in the aftermath of the abusive relationship. The reason for it is that we become hypersensitive to our environment due to the PTSD. It can be difficult to tell what is a real threat and what isn’t. If this is something you’re going through, it may be a sign that you need to remain in a hibernation mode in order to heal. Also, it is okay to err on the side of caution for some time and avoid questionable characters and situations. For more on how you can get your intuition and self-trust back online, check out my recent video on this topic.', 'The period of overcoming and healing from narcissistic abuse is an exceptional opportunity for growth. This is because now we have an unimpeded look at our vulnerabilities. This is not easy to do, which is why most people never get this deep and instead remain stuck in more-less the same modus–operandi for majority of their life, even while desiring change.', 'But real change can only occur as a result of deep work. A key to this work is self-inquiry (included as the fourth niyama in Ashtanga Yoga). If enlightenment was ever on your list, know you now have a leg up. Awakening from the prison bond of narcissistic abuse is a potent form of awakening.', 'Here are some examples of perhaps what you are discovering as your greatest vulnerabilities that keep attracting manipulators into your life:', 'Need for security — likely a flashback to childhood, a symptom of fatherly neglect. One of the most fundamental roles of the father is to instill in his child a sense of self-protection by demonstrating it in his actions. Lack of this makes us set out into the world with an impaired sense of security.', 'Need for adoration — often a symptom of not getting enough nurturing in childhood and instead being brushed aside. Ignorance from parents can later manifest as low self-regard and a lack of confidence. This puts as at the risk of biting the predator’s hook the moment the sweet nothings begin to roll off their tongue.', 'Need for acknowledgement — whether of our attractiveness, intelligence, significance, etc., many of us walk around with empty buckets and a nagging sense of feeling ‘less than.’ What’s ironic is that it is often the case even if we have many accomplishments under our belt. This is because the sense of feeling insignificant or unimportant doesn’t dwell on the surface. It is lodged deep inside your subconscious. To get there, requires learning to persistently give acknowledgement to yourself through mastering the art of positive self-talk. The amazing thing about this is — once you grasp it, you will cease your dependence on anyone else’s opinion of you. It is the key to true freedom.', 'Taking a trip back to childhood is a necessary component of healing if we want lasting results. It will create a sense of inner cohesion, eliminate much unresolved pain and restore deeper connection to self-trust. The little one inside you needs your help. They need you to see them, hear them, love then and guide them. There is no better person I could recommend here than the work of John Bradshaw. His ten-part video series titled ‘Homecoming’ was instrumental in getting me out of a dark hole of despair and into a sunshine bathed meadow of innocence where my little girl and I got to really connect. This time for good.', 'There will be a long period of time where you will feel pulled towards the past. It is cognitive dissonance and trauma bond at work. It is a sign that there are still things you need to understand and emotions to process. It is absolutely necessary to continue this work, but instead of letting the past steal your present moments, set aside dedicated time to do just that.', 'Meanwhile, practice staying mindful in the present and thinking of the future you’d like to create for yourself. Resurrect your dreams, maybe even give them an upgrade. Having a sense of purpose in life and things to look forward to helps us overcome the pull of the trauma and launches us forward. Knowing your ‘why’ is a good place to start. It shifts you from being a victim to becoming the hero of your life.', 'For starters, know this — healing from narcissistic abuse will make you a more integrated, whole, aware and self-loving person. It can be a gift. What you do with it is really up to you.', 'As I mentioned above, the inner quiet voice is your best friend. Even, and especially, while you are in the midst of chaos and pain, it can help navigate you out of suffering. There are many reasons why we experienced narcissistic abuse. Many of those reasons were outside our control. The world is full of manipulative characters who live to fulfill their own agenda. Now it is time for you to take your destiny back in your hands.', 'You can practice listening to the voice by asking yourself: how do I feel now? If you are faced with a choice, always go with the inner feeling. If you feel relaxed and open, the answer is a yes. If you are on the fence, it is likely better to hold back.', 'The inner voice of your intuition will help guide you to your new life in which you are have more control because you now know yourself and what you want much better. It is a life full of possibilities and harmony where your inner desires and outside manifestation can finally match one another.', 'Being in an abusive relationship made us constantly dwell in a state of hyper-vigilance, even if we were not aware of it. Even during the highs, the intensity of the relationship made it seem like we are on a roller coaster ride. Other times, we were walking on our tip-toes not to disturb the abuser.', 'All this overstimulated our sympathetic system, pumping chemicals of stress into our bloodstream. It is one of the reasons we were so exhausted while in the relationship.', 'To override this, we can activate our parasympathetic system, switching from fight or flight to rest and digest. How to do this? Activate your vagus nerve. One of my favorite way to do this is by practicing deep breathing, taking cold showers and laying on my right side. Here to inspire more ideas, I provide a link to an article that goes deeper into the subject and offers a plethora of activities to help you quell your anxiety.', 'Whether you get upset at yourself because you slipped up and fallen right back to the pit, or get frustrated that you are not making faster progress and instead crying again, please be kind to yourself. This healing requires deep work and deep work requires time.', 'Every one of us has different rhythms, has gone through different, though similar, experiences and therefore will need more or less time to heal. But know one thing, no matter how long it will take you, with persistence and commitment to yourself, you will get there. One step at a time. It is simply inevitable.', 'I hope this post was helpful to you and look forward to meeting you in the comments.

This time, we asked: What book was your feminist awakening?', 'The painting on the cover stopped me in my tracks, right there in the science fiction/fantasy section of Waldenbooks at Chapel Hill Mall in Akron, Ohio. The central figure is a woman. She’s not naked, nor is she wearing an armored bikini or an approximation of medieval dress that allows for ample cleavage. Instead, she is wearing a voluminous robe, her long, dark hair bound by a simple coronet. She is sitting on a beautiful white horse and grasping a sword by its blade. She looks determined, but serene, fully self-sufficient.', 'There’s not a man in sight.', 'And that evocative title! The Mists of Avalon. I’d already read — and loved — T. H. White’s The Once and Future King, which had led me to Howard Pyle’s take on Arthurian legend, as well as John Steinbeck’s. I’d even muddled through La Morte d’Arthur. Bradley’s reference to the island where Arthur rests made me feel like an insider, while the marketing copy suggested something radically different than anything I’d encountered before: Arthurian legend, from the female perspective.', 'I still cannot imagine anything more perfectly aligned with my thirteen-year-old sensibilities than Marion Zimmer Bradley’s masterpiece. Bradley opened my eyes to the idea that, when we look at the past, we are only ever seeing a small part of it — and usually, what we are seeing excludes the experiences of women. Encountering the vain, self-serving, diabolical Morgan le Fay transformed into the priestess Morgaine compelled me to question other received narratives in which women are to blame for the failures of men. The Mists of Avalon also gave me a glimpse of spiritual possibilities beyond male-dominated, male-defined religions. In retrospect, I can see that it gave me ways of seeing that helped me find the feminine even within patriarchal systems while studying religion as an undergrad. The impact of this book lingers in my feminism, certainly, but it also influenced my scholarly interest in folklore, and it still informs my personal spirituality.', 'But my primary reaction to The Mists of Avalon, when I first read it, wasn’t intellectual; it was emotional. Like The Once and Future King, Bradley’s novel follows its protagonist from childhood into old age. I sympathized with the girl Morgaine, and her adolescent experiences hinted at frustrations I was just beginning to feel. The moment when Morgaine and Lancelet are, finally, about to become lovers — and then Gwenhwyfar, blonde and fair and lithe and helpless, stumbles into Avalon… No matter how many times I revisit this scene, it still crushes me. This isn’t a story about the pretty girl, the princess. It’s the story of the smart girl who becomes a powerful woman. Even so, Bradley brings nuance to these characters. She shows us Morgaine doing foolish, selfish things, and she shows us that Gwenhwyfar’s position is an impossible one. Doom hangs over Arthur’s glorious reign, just as fate rules many a legend and fable. There is no happy ending for anyone at Camelot — there never has been — but Bradley shows us real people struggling against their destiny, and she shows us that it’s not just impersonal fortune to blame for their inevitable downfall. Instead, it’s systems of oppression. By the time I left home for a women’s college in 1989, I’d reread The Mists of Avalon several times. I arrived ready to smash the patriarchy.', 'By the time I left home for a women’s college, I’d reread The Mists of Avalon several times. I arrived ready to smash the patriarchy.', 'And then, in 2014, Moira Greyland, Marion Zimmer Bradley’s daughter, told the world that her mother had sexually abused her and many other children for more than a decade. I didn’t even know how to process this information. I believed Greyland, absolutely, but I just couldn’t make this revelation fit with The Mists of Avalon and what that book meant to me. Bradley was not an author to whom I had a personal attachment. I’d never gotten into anything she’d written besides The Mists of Avalon. Had I been more of a fan, I might have seen the pedophilia threaded through her other work. I might have known that Walter Breen — Bradley’s husband and Greyland’s father — died in prison after being convicted of molesting a child. (Greyland says that there were many, many more victims.) Had I been more of a fan, I might have known that rumors about Bradley and Breen had circulated in the science fiction and fantasy communities for years.', 'My connection wasn’t with Bradley, though. My connection was with Morgaine and Viviane and Morgause — the characters Bradley created. When I read Greyland’s story, I immediately thought of one scene in The Mists of Avalon that suddenly seemed suspect, but that was it. Wondering what I might have missed, I decided to read the novel one more time.', 'The scene that I remembered was right where it had always been:', 'She stretched out her arms, and at her command she knew that outside the cave, in the light of the fecundating fires, man and woman, drawn one to the other by the pulsating surges of life, came together. The little blue-painted girl who had borne the fertilizing blood was drawn down into the arms of a sinewy old hunter, and Morgaine saw her briefly struggle and cry out, go down under his body, her legs opening to the irresistible force of nature in them.', 'The sexual act described here takes place around the Beltane fire. As a young reader, I was disturbed by it, but I saw it as a description of people who have passed beyond the normal world and into the sacred time of a fertility ritual. The scene was frightening for me as a child, and repellent, but also, I must admit, fascinating. In context, this passage made sense: The horror of the scene was an element of its power.', 'electricliterature.com', 'And that was all I found. Everything I had always loved about the book was still there, and I didn’t find anything new to hate. So, what was I going to do with this book?', 'This is, of course, a version of the question we’re all asking ourselves at the moment. How do we separate the artist from the art? Should we? Can we? I have found that my own answers vary. Woody Allen’s face makes Annie Hall, Crimes and Misdemeanors, and Hannah and Her Sisters — all movies I’ve adored — impossible. I’m also done with Louis C.K., but I’m not even ready to think about the colleagues and collaborators — Pamela Adlon? Aziz Ansari? — who have supported him, even as I, myself, was long willing to let “rumors” be “rumors.” Losing Kevin Spacey isn’t hard for me, but forswearing Harvey Weinstein forever means forgetting about a long list of great movies. And Weinstein was a producer — a facilitator more than a creator. Is his connection to a film close enough to make that film anathema?', 'Jodi Kantor, Megan Twohey, and Ronan Farrow’s reporting on Weinstein seems to be a tipping point for sexual harassment and assault in Hollywood, but we’re also seeing women and men come forward in journalism, publishing, and academia. The question of separating the abuser from his work metastasizes, and I don’t have any easy answers. Or, rather, I do have one easy answer: When someone says they’ve been assaulted, abused, harassed, I believe them. But I believe them, in part, because of lessons I absorbed from The Mists of Avalon.', 'When someone says they’ve been assaulted, abused, harassed, I believe them. But I believe them, in part, because of lessons I absorbed from The Mists of Avalon.', 'So, what to do with this once-beloved book? I’ve read it once since Greyland spoke out, and I don’t know if I will read it again. Probably not, I’m guessing. Discovering that powerful men are predators is disturbing, but not surprising. Learning that the author who introduced me to feminine spirituality and the hidden side of history abused children — girls and boys, her own daughter — was horrifying in an existential kind of way. I’m a writer and an editor and I know that characters can exceed their creators. I would go so far as to say that that’s the goal. So I can keep Morgaine — what she has meant to me, what she has become in my personal mythology — while I reject Bradley.', 'I no longer recommend The Mists of Avalon to other readers, and I can’t imagine burdening a child with it. There are other stories. Monica Furlong’s books Wise Child and Juniper are now my go-to titles for youngsters. Manda Scott’s Boudica series are the books that I wish I had found when I was thirteen, and I’m eagerly awaiting the sequel to Nicola Griffith’s Hild. It’s entirely possible that these stories about powerful women might never have been published if not for the success of The Mists of Avalon. This is part of Bradley’s legacy, too. But, even if I can appreciate the extent to which this author created a space for a new kind of writing in fantasy, I am still haunted by the voices she silenced.', 'Learning that the author who introduced me to feminine spirituality and the hidden side of history abused children was horrifying in an existential kind of way.', 'When she finally came forward with her story, Greyland said,', '[O]ne reason I never said anything is that I regarded her life as being more important than mine: her fame more important, and assuredly the comfort of her fans as more important. Those who knew me, knew the truth about her, but beyond that, it did not matter what she had done to me, as long as her work and her reputation continued.', 'I believe Moira Greyland.

Spicer openly lied about Trump’s inaugural crowd in Washington, DC being “the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe.” Here is a time-lapse video from PBS that shows that the inauguration viewing area was never full at any time that day, even at the height of the festivities.', 'Conway said Spicer was merely using “alternative facts.” Clearly, they are both liars, as is their boss. But why?', 'I wrote about this on Twitter but I think it is perhaps more effectively shared in a very short essay here. Some of this will be familiar to you if you have experience with abusers and/or survivors. Some of it may be painful. Please understand that abuse does not merely mean hitting or sexual assault. Abuse can be emotional and psychological as well.', 'There is a blueprint for this type of behavior — the lies, the covering up, the refusal to acknowledge reality.

However, the opposite is true. Use of psychological, emotional, and physical abuse intermingled with periods of respite, love, and happiness are deliberate coercive tools used to generate submission…Many will buy flowers, candy and other presents in order to win favor and forgiveness.

He said that when the police arrived that evening, Kelly was distraught and told an officer that she wanted to kill herself. So an ambulance was called, and the 15-year-old was strapped to a gurney, taken to a psychiatric hospital, and monitored for safety before being released. Days after being hospitalized, Kelly was brought to my office by her parents who wanted to get help for their troubled girl.', 'Kelly’s parents spoke first. They said that their daughter’s hospitalization was the culmination of a yearlong downward spiral spurred by her phone obsession. Kelly had been refusing to spend time with her family or focus on school. Instead, she favored living her life on social media. A previously happy girl and strong student, Kelly had grown angry, sullen, and was now bringing home report cards with sinking grades. Kelly’s parents had tried many times in prior months to set limits on their daughter’s phone use, but she had become increasingly defiant and deceitful, even sneaking on her phone at all hours of the night.', 'When Kelly’s latest report card revealed a number of failing grades, her parents felt compelled to act. They told Kelly early in the afternoon on the day the police were called that she would need to turn in her phone by 9 p.m. But when the time came, Kelly refused, and a pushing match ensued between her and her parents, concluding in the violent tantrum that led the girl to be hospitalized.', 'I asked Kelly, who was sitting in a corner, to help me understand her perspective on that evening. She didn’t respond and instead glared at her parents. But then, surprising everyone in the room, she cried, “They took my f***ing phone!” Attempting to engage Kelly in conversation, I asked her what she liked about her phone and social media. “They make me happy,” she replied.', 'As Kelly and her family continued their appointments with me in the coming months, two concerns dominated our meetings. The first was that Kelly’s unhealthy attachment to her phone continued, causing almost constant tension at home. The second concern emerged during my meetings with Kelly’s parents alone. Even though they were loving and involved parents, Kelly’s mom couldn’t help feeling that they’d failed their daughter and must have done something terribly wrong that led to her problems.', 'My practice as a child and adolescent psychologist is filled with families like Kelly’s. These parents say their kids’ extreme overuse of phones, video games, and social media is the most difficult parenting issue they face — and, in many cases, is tearing the family apart. Preteen and teen girls refuse to get off their phones, even though it’s remarkably clear that the devices are making them miserable. I also see far too many boys whose gaming obsessions lead them to forgo interest in school, extracurricular activities, and anything else productive. Some of these boys, as they reach their later teens, use their large bodies to terrorize parents who attempt to set gaming limits. A common thread running through many of these cases is parent guilt, as so many are certain they did something to put their kids on a destructive path.', 'What none of these parents understand is that their children’s and teens’ destructive obsession with technology is the predictable consequence of a virtually unrecognized merger between the tech industry and psychology. This alliance pairs the consumer tech industry’s immense wealth with the most sophisticated psychological research, making it possible to develop social media, video games, and phones with drug-like power to seduce young users.', 'These parents have no idea that lurking behind their kids’ screens and phones are a multitude of psychologists, neuroscientists, and social science experts who use their knowledge of psychological vulnerabilities to devise products that capture kids’ attention for the sake of industry profit. What these parents and most of the world have yet to grasp is that psychology — a discipline that we associate with healing — is now being used as a weapon against children.', 'Nestled in an unremarkable building on the Stanford University campus in Palo Alto, California, is the Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab, founded in 1998. The lab’s creator, Dr. B.J. Fogg, is a psychologist and the father of persuasive technology, a discipline in which digital machines and apps — including smartphones, social media, and video games — are configured to alter human thoughts and behaviors. As the lab’s website boldly proclaims: “Machines designed to change humans.”', 'Fogg speaks openly of the ability to use smartphones and other digital devices to change our ideas and actions: “We can now create machines that can change what people think and what people do, and the machines can do that autonomously.” Called “the millionaire maker,” Fogg has groomed former students who have used his methods to develop technologies that now consume kids’ lives. As he recently touted on his personal website, “My students often do groundbreaking projects, and they continue having impact in the real world after they leave Stanford… For example, Instagram has influenced the behavior of over 800 million people. The co-founder was a student of mine.”', 'Intriguingly, there are signs that Fogg is feeling the heat from recent scrutiny of the use of digital devices to alter behavior. His boast about Instagram, which was present on his website as late as January of 2018, has been removed. Fogg’s website also has lately undergone a substantial makeover, as he now seems to go out of his way to suggest his work has benevolent aims, commenting, “I teach good people how behavior works so they can create products & services that benefit everyday people around the world.” Likewise, the Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab website optimistically claims, “Persuasive technologies can bring about positive changes in many domains, including health, business, safety, and education. We also believe that new advances in technology can help promote world peace in 30 years.”', 'While Fogg emphasizes persuasive design’s sunny future, he is quite indifferent to the disturbing reality now: that hidden influence techniques are being used by the tech industry to hook and exploit users for profit. His enthusiastic vision also conveniently neglects to include how this generation of children and teens, with their highly malleable minds, is being manipulated and hurt by forces unseen.', 'If you haven’t heard of persuasive technology, that’s no accident — tech corporations would prefer it to remain in the shadows, as most of us don’t want to be controlled and have a special aversion to kids being manipulated for profit. Persuasive technology (also called persuasive design) works by deliberately creating digital environments that users feel fulfill their basic human drives — to be social or obtain goals — better than real-world alternatives. Kids spend countless hours in social media and video game environments in pursuit of likes, “friends,” game points, and levels — because it’s stimulating, they believe that this makes them happy and successful, and they find it easier than doing the difficult but developmentally important activities of childhood.', 'While persuasion techniques work well on adults, they are particularly effective at influencing the still-maturing child and teen brain. “Video games, better than anything else in our culture, deliver rewards to people, especially teenage boys,” says Fogg. “Teenage boys are wired to seek competency. To master our world and get better at stuff. Video games, in dishing out rewards, can convey to people that their competency is growing, you can get better at something second by second.” And it’s persuasive design that’s helped convince this generation of boys they are gaining “competency” by spending countless hours on game sites, when the sad reality is they are locked away in their rooms gaming, ignoring school, and not developing the real-world competencies that colleges and employers demand.', 'Likewise, social media companies use persuasive design to prey on the age-appropriate desire for preteen and teen kids, especially girls, to be socially successful. This drive is built into our DNA, since real-world relational skills have fostered human evolution. The Huffington Post article, “What Really Happens On a Teen Girl’s iPhone” describes the life of 14-year-old Casey from Millburn, New Jersey. With 580 friends on Instagram and 1,110 on Facebook, she’s preoccupied with the number of “likes” her Facebook profile picture receives compared with her peers. As she says, “If you don’t get 100 ‘likes,’ you make other people share it so you get 100…. Or else you just get upset. Everyone wants to get the most ‘likes.’ It’s like a popularity contest.”', 'Article author Bianca Bosker says that there are costs to Casey’s phone obsession, noting that the “girl’s phone, be it Facebook, Instagram or iMessage, is constantly pulling her away from her homework, sleep, or conversations with her family.” Casey says she wishes she could put her phone down. But she can’t. “I’ll wake up in the morning and go on Facebook just… because,” she says. “It’s not like I want to or I don’t. I just go on it. I’m, like, forced to. I don’t know why. I need to. Facebook takes up my whole life.”', 'B.J. Fogg may not be a household name, but Fortune Magazine calls him a “New Guru You Should Know,” and his research is driving a worldwide legion of user experience (UX) designers who utilize and expand upon his models of persuasive design. As Forbes Magazine writer Anthony Wing Kosner notes, “No one has perhaps been as influential on the current generation of user experience (UX) designers as Stanford researcher B.J. Fogg.”', 'UX designers come from many disciplines, including psychology as well as brain and computer sciences. However, the core of some UX research is about using psychology to take advantage of our human vulnerabilities. That’s particularly pernicious when the targets are children. As Fogg is quoted in Kosner’s Forbes article, “Facebook, Twitter, Google, you name it, these companies have been using computers to influence our behavior.” However, the driving force behind behavior change isn’t computers. “The missing link isn’t the technology, it’s psychology,” says Fogg.', 'UX researchers not only often follow Fogg’s design model, but some may also share his apparent tendency to overlook the broader implications of persuasive design. They focus on the task at hand, building digital machines and apps that better demand users’ attention, compel users to return again and again, and grow businesses’ bottom line. Less considered can be how the world’s children are affected by thousands of UX designers working simultaneously to pull them onto a multitude of digital devices and products at the expense of real life.', 'According to B.J. Fogg, the “Fogg Behavior Model” is a well-tested method to change behavior and, in its simplified form, involves three primary factors: motivation, ability, and triggers. Describing how his formula is effective at getting people to use a social network, the psychologist says in an academic paper that a key motivator is users’ desire for “social acceptance,” although he says an even more powerful motivator is the desire “to avoid being socially rejected.” Regarding ability, Fogg suggests that digital products should be made so that users don’t have to “think hard.” Hence, social networks are designed for ease of use. Finally, Fogg says that potential users need to be triggered to use a site. This is accomplished by a myriad of digital tricks, including the sending of incessant notifications urging users to view friends’ pictures, telling them they are missing out while not on the social network, or suggesting that they check — yet again — to see if anyone liked their post or photo.', 'Fogg’s formula is the blueprint for building multibillion dollar social media and gaming companies. However, moral questions about the impact of turning persuasive techniques on children and teens are not being asked. For example, should the fear of social rejection be used to compel kids to compulsively use social media? Is it okay to lure kids away from school tasks that demand a strong mental effort so they can spend their lives on social networks or playing video games that don’t make them think much at all? And is it okay to incessantly trigger kids to use revenue-producing digital products at the expense of engaging with family and other important real-life activities?', 'Persuasive technologies work because of their apparent triggering of the release of dopamine, a powerful neurotransmitter involved in reward, attention, and addiction. In the Venice region of Los Angeles, now dubbed “Silicon Beach,” the startup Dopamine Labs boasts about its use of persuasive techniques to increase profits: “Connect your app to our Persuasive AI [Artificial Intelligence] and lift your engagement and revenue up to 30% by giving your users our perfect bursts of dopamine,” and “A burst of Dopamine doesn’t just feel good: it’s proven to re-wire user behavior and habits.”', 'Ramsay Brown, the founder of Dopamine Labs, says in a KQED Science article, “We have now developed a rigorous technology of the human mind, and that is both exciting and terrifying. We have the ability to twiddle some knobs in a machine learning dashboard we build, and around the world hundreds of thousands of people are going to quietly change their behavior in ways that, unbeknownst to them, feel second-nature but are really by design.” Programmers call this “brain hacking,” as it compels users to spend more time on sites even though they mistakenly believe it’s strictly due to their own conscious choices.', 'Social networks and video games use the trusted brain-manipulation technique of variable reward (think slot machine). Users never know when they will get the next “like” or game reward, and it’s delivered at the perfect time to foster maximal stimulation and keep them on the site. Banks of computers employ AI to “learn” which of a countless number of persuasive design elements will keep users hooked. A persuasion profile of a particular user’s unique vulnerabilities is developed in real time and exploited to keep users on the site and make them return again and again for longer periods of time. This drives up profits for consumer internet companies whose revenue is based on how much their products are used.', 'Clandestine techniques that manipulate users to fulfill a profit motive are regarded by programmers as “dark design.” Why would firms resort to such tactics? As former tech executive Bill Davidow says in his Atlantic article “Exploiting the Neuroscience of Internet Addiction,” “The leaders of Internet companies face an interesting, if also morally questionable, imperative: either they hijack neuroscience to gain market share and make large profits, or they let competitors do that and run away with the market.”', 'There are few industries as cutthroat and unregulated as Silicon Valley. Social media and video game companies believe they are compelled to use persuasive technology in the arms race for attention, profits, and survival. Children’s well-being is not part of the decision calculus.', 'While social media and video game companies have been surprisingly successful at hiding their use of persuasive design from the public, one breakthrough occurred in 2017 when Facebook documents were leaked to The Australian. The internal report crafted by Facebook executives showed the social network boasting to advertisers that by monitoring posts, interactions, and photos in real time, the network is able to track when teens feel “insecure,” “worthless,” “stressed,” “useless” and a “failure.” Why would the social network do this? The report also bragged about Facebook’s ability to micro-target ads down to “moments when young people need a confidence boost.”', 'Persuasive technology’s use of digital media to target children, deploying the weapon of psychological manipulation at just the right moment, is what makes it so powerful. These design techniques provide tech corporations a window into kids’ hearts and minds to measure their particular vulnerabilities, which can then be used to control their behavior as consumers. This isn’t some strange future… this is now. Facebook claimed the leaked report was misrepresented in the press. But when child advocates called on the social network to release it, the company refused to do so, preferring to keep the techniques it uses to influence kids shrouded in secrecy.', 'The official tech industry line is that persuasive technologies are used to make products more engaging and enjoyable. But the revelations of industry insiders can reveal darker motives. Video game developer John Hopson, who has a Ph.D. in behavioral and brain science, wrote the paper “Behavioral Game Design.” He describes the use of design features to alter video game player behavior, sounding much like an experimenter running lab animals through their paces, answering questions such as: “How do we make players maintain a high, consistent rate of activity?” and “How to make players play forever.”', 'Revealing the hard science behind persuasive technology, Hopson says, “This is not to say that players are the same as rats, but that there are general rules of learning which apply equally to both.” After penning the paper, Hopson was hired by Microsoft, where he helped lead the development of the Xbox Live, Microsoft’s online gaming system. He also assisted in the development of Xbox games popular with kids, including those in the Halo series. The parents I work with simply have no idea about the immense amount of financial and psychological firepower aimed at their children to keep them playing video games “forever.”', 'Another persuasive technology expert is Bill Fulton, a game designer who trained in cognitive and quantitative psychology. He started Microsoft’s Games User-Research group before founding his own consulting agency. Fulton is transparent about the power of persuasive design and the intent of the gaming industry, disclosing in Big Four Accounting Firm PwC’s tech business journal: “If game designers are going to pull a person away from every other voluntary social activity or hobby or pastime, they’re going to have to engage that person at a very deep level in every possible way they can.”', 'This is a major effect of persuasive design today: building video games and social media products so compelling that they pull users away from the real world to spend their lives in for-profit domains. But to engage in a pursuit at the expense of important real-world activities is a core element of addiction. And there is increasing evidence that persuasive design has now become so potent that it is capable of contributing to video game and internet addictions — diagnoses that are officially recognized in China, South Korea, and Japan, and which are under consideration in the U.S.', 'Not only does persuasive design appear to drive kids’ addictions to devices, but knowledge of addiction is used to make persuasive design more effective at hijacking the mind. As Dopamine Labs’ Ramsay Brown acknowledges in an episode of CBS’s 60 Minutes, “Since we’ve figured to some extent how these pieces of the brain that handle addiction are working, people have figured out how to juice them further and how to bake that information into apps.”', 'The creation of digital products with drug-like effects that are able to “pull a person away” from engaging in real-life activities is the reason why persuasive technology is profoundly destructive. Today, persuasive design is likely distracting adults from driving safely, productive work, and engaging with their own children — all matters which need urgent attention. Still, because the child and adolescent brain is more easily controlled than the adult mind, the use of persuasive design is having a much more hurtful impact on kids.', 'Persuasive technologies are reshaping childhood, luring kids away from family and schoolwork to spend more and more of their lives sitting before screens and phones. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation report, younger U.S. children now spend 5 ½ hours each day with entertainment technologies, including video games, social media, and online videos. Even more, the average teen now spends an incredible 8 hours each day playing with screens and phones. Productive uses of technology — where persuasive design is much less a factor — are almost an afterthought, as U.S. kids only spend 16 minutes each day using the computer at home for school.', 'Quietly, using screens and phones for entertainment has become the dominant activity of childhood. Younger kids spend more time engaging with entertainment screens than they do in school, and teens spend even more time playing with screens and phones than they do sleeping. The result is apparent in restaurants, the car sitting next to you at the stoplight, and even many classrooms: Attesting to the success of persuasive technology, kids are so taken with their phones and other devices that they have turned their backs to the world around them. Hiding in bedrooms on devices, or consumed by their phones in the presence of family, many children are missing out on real-life engagement with family and school — the two cornerstones of childhood that lead them to grow up happy and successful. Even during the few moments kids have away from their devices, they are often preoccupied with one thought: getting back on them.', 'In addition to the displacement of healthy childhood activities, persuasive technologies are pulling kids into often toxic digital environments. A too frequent experience for many is being cyberbullied, which increases their risk of skipping school and considering suicide. And there is growing recognition of the negative impact of FOMO, or the fear of missing out, as kids spend their social media lives watching a parade of peers who look to be having a great time without them, feeding their feelings of loneliness and being less than.', 'The combined effects of the displacement of vital childhood activities and exposure to unhealthy online environments is wrecking a generation. In her recent Atlantic article, “Have Smartphones Destroyed a Generation?,” Dr. Jean Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University, describes how long hours spent on smartphones and social media are driving teen girls in the U.S. to experience high rates of depression and suicidal behaviors.', 'And as the typical age when kids get their first smartphone has fallen to 10, it’s no surprise to see serious psychiatric problems — once the domain of teens — now enveloping young kids. Self-inflicted injuries, such as cutting, that are serious enough to require treatment in an emergency room, have increased dramatically in 10- to 14-year-old girls, up 19% per year since 2009.', 'While girls are pulled onto smartphones and social media, boys are more likely to be seduced into the world of video gaming, often at the expense of a focus on school. High amounts of gaming are linked to lower grades, so with boys gaming more than girls, it’s no surprise to see this generation of boys struggling to make it to college: a full 57% of college admissions are granted to young women compared with only 43% to young men. And, as boys transition to manhood, they can’t shake their gaming habits. Economists working with the National Bureau of Economic Research recently demonstrated how many young U.S. men are choosing to play video games rather than join the workforce.', 'As a child and adolescent psychologist myself, the inevitable conclusion is both embarrassing and heartbreaking. The destructive forces of psychology deployed by the tech industry are making a greater impact on kids than the positive uses of psychology by mental health providers and child advocates. Put plainly, the science of psychology is hurting kids more than helping them.', 'Hope for this wired generation has seemed dim until recently, when a surprising group has come forward to criticize the tech industry’s use of psychological manipulation: tech executives. Tristan Harris, formerly a design ethicist at Google, has led the way by unmasking the industry’s use of persuasive design. Interviewed in The Economist’s 1843 magazine, he says, “The job of these companies is to hook people, and they do that by hijacking our psychological vulnerabilities.”', 'Another tech exec raising red flags about his tech industry’s use of mind manipulation is former Facebook president Sean Parker. Interviewed in Axios, he discloses: “The thought process that went into building these applications, Facebook being the first of them… was all about: ‘How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?’” He also said that Facebook exploits “vulnerability in human psychology” and remarked, “God only knows what it’s doing to our children’s brains.”', 'A theme advanced by these tech execs is that the industry is unfairly using persuasive technology to gain a profit advantage. “Consumer internet businesses are about exploiting psychology,” Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook VP says in a talk ironically given at B.J. Fogg’s Stanford University. “We want to psychologically figure out how to manipulate you as fast as possible and then give you back that dopamine hit.”', 'Having children of their own can change tech execs’ perspective. Tony Fadell, formerly at Apple, is considered the father of the iPad and also of much of the iPhone. He is also the founder and current CEO of Nest. “A lot of the designers and coders who were in their 20s when we were creating these things didn’t have kids. Now they have kids,” Fadell remarks, while speaking at the Design Museum in London. “And they see what’s going on, and they say, ‘Wait a second.’ And they start to rethink their design decisions.”', 'Marc Benioff, CEO of the cloud computing company Salesforce, is one of the voices calling for the regulation of social media companies because of their potential to addict children. He says that just as the cigarette industry has been regulated, so too should social media companies. “I think that, for sure, technology has addictive qualities that we have to address, and that product designers are working to make those products more addictive, and we need to rein that back as much as possible,” Benioff told CNBC in January, 2018, while in Davos, Switzerland, site of the World Economic Forum.', 'Benioff says that parents should do their part to limit their kids’ devices, yet expressed, “If there’s an unfair advantage or things that are out there that are not understood by parents, then the government’s got to come forward and illuminate that.” Since millions of parents, for example the parents of my patient Kelly, have absolutely no idea that devices are used to hijack their children’s minds and lives, regulation of such practices is the right thing to do.', 'Another improbable group to speak out on behalf of children is tech investors. Major Apple stockholders — the hedge fund Jana Partners and California State Teachers’ Retirement System, which collectively own $2 billion in the firm’s stock — have recently raised concerns that persuasive design is contributing to kids’ suffering. In an open letter to Apple, the investors, teaming up with leading child technology experts, detailed evidence that kids’ overuse of phones and devices is leading to their increased risk of depression and suicide risk factors. Specifically calling out the destructive impact of persuasive technology, the letter reads: “It is also no secret that social media sites and applications for which the iPhone and iPad are a primary gateway are usually designed to be as addictive and time-consuming as possible.”', 'How has the consumer tech industry responded to these calls for change? By going even lower. Facebook recently launched Messenger Kids, a social media app that will reach kids as young as five years old. Suggestive that harmful persuasive design is now honing in on very young children is the declaration of Messenger Kids Art Director, Shiu Pei Luu, “We want to help foster communication [on Facebook] and make that the most exciting thing you want to be doing.”', 'Facebook’s narrow-minded vision of childhood is reflective of how out of touch the social network and other consumer tech companies are with the needs of an increasingly troubled generation. The most “exciting thing” for young children should be spending time with family, playing outside, engaging in creative play, and other vital developmental experiences — not being drawn into the social media vortex on phones or tablets. Moreover, Facebook Messenger Kids is giving an early start to the wired life on social media that we know poses risks of depression and suicide-related behavior for older children.', 'In response to the release of Facebook’s Messenger Kids, the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC) sent Facebook a letter signed by numerous health advocates calling on the company to pull the plug on the app. Facebook has yet to respond to the letter and instead continues to aggressively market Messenger Kids for young children.', 'While tech execs and investors are speaking out against the tech industry’s psychological manipulation of children, the American Psychological Association (APA) — which is tasked with protecting children and families from harmful psychological practices — has been essentially silent on the matter. This is not suggestive of malice; instead, the APA leadership — much like parents — is likely unaware of the tech industry’s distorted use of psychology. Nonetheless, there is irony, as psychologists and their powerful tools are guided by ethics, while tech execs and investors are not.', 'The Ethics Code of the APA, U.S psychology’s chief professional organization, is quite clear: “Psychologists strive to benefit those with whom they work and take care to do no harm.” Moreover, APA Ethical Standards require the profession to make efforts to correct the “misuse” of the work of psychologists, which would include the application of B.J. Fogg’s persuasive technologies to influence children against their best interests. The code even provides special protection to kids because their developmental “vulnerabilities impair autonomous decision making.”', 'Manipulating children for profit without their own or parents’ consent, and driving kids to spend more time on devices that contribute to emotional and academic problems is the embodiment of unethical psychological practice. Silicon Valley corporations and the investment firms that support them are heavily populated by highly privileged white men who use concealed mind-bending techniques to control the lives of defenseless kids. Addressing this inequity is Tristan Harris, who says, “Never before in history have basically 50 mostly men, mostly 20–35, mostly white engineer designer types within 50 miles of where we are right now [Silicon Valley], had control of what a billion people think and do.” Harris was recounting an excerpt of a presentation he made while at Google during an interview with journalist Kara Swisher for Recode Decode in February of 2017.', 'Some may argue that it’s the parents’ responsibility to protect their children from tech industry deception. However, parents have no idea of the powerful forces aligned against them, nor do they know how technologies are developed with drug-like effects to capture kids’ minds. Parents simply can’t protect their children or teens from something that’s concealed and unknown to them.', 'Others will claim that nothing should be done because the intention behind persuasive design is to build better products, not manipulate kids. In fact, for those working in the user experience and persuasion fields, I’m sure there is no intent to harm children. The negative consequences of persuasive technology have been for the most part accidental, an unfortunate byproduct of an exceptionally competitive design process. However, similar circumstances exist in the cigarette industry, as tobacco companies have as their intention profiting from the sale of their product, not hurting children. Nonetheless, because cigarettes and persuasive design predictably harm children, actions should be taken to protect kids from their effects.', 'Since its inception, the field of persuasive technology has operated in a moral vacuum. The resulting tragedy is not surprising.', 'In truth, the harmful potential of using persuasive design has long been recognized. Fogg, himself, says in a 1999 journal article, “Persuasive computers can also be used for destructive purposes; the dark side of changing attitudes and behaviors leads toward manipulation and coercion.” And in a 1998 academic paper, Fogg describes what should happen if things go wrong, saying, if persuasive technologies are “deemed harmful or questionable in some regard, a researcher should then either take social action or advocate that others do so.”', 'More recently, Fogg has actually acknowledged the ill effects of persuasive design. Interviewed by Ian Leslie in 2016 for The Economist’s 1843 Magazine, Fogg says, “I look at some of my former students and I wonder if they’re really trying to make the world better, or just make money.” And in 2017 when Fogg was interviewed by 032c Magazine, he acknowledged, “You look around the restaurants and pretty much everyone has their phone on the table and they’re just being constantly drawn away from the live face-to-face interaction — I do think that’s a bad thing.” Nonetheless, Fogg hasn’t taken meaningful action to help those hurt by the field he fathered. Nor have those in positions of power, with the recent exception of tech execs coming forward, done anything to limit the manipulative and coercive use of digital machines against children and teens.', 'So, how can children be protected from the tech industry’s use of persuasive design? I suggest turning to President John F. Kennedy’s prescient guidance: He said that technology “has no conscience of its own. Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man.” I believe that the psychology profession, with its understanding of the mind and ethics code as guidance, can step forward to become a conscience guiding how tech corporations interact with children and teens.', 'The APA should begin by demanding that the tech industry’s behavioral manipulation techniques be brought out of the shadows and exposed to the light of public awareness. Changes should be made in the APA’s Ethics Code to specifically prevent psychologists from manipulating children using digital machines, especially if such influence is known to pose risks to their well-being. Moreover, the APA should follow its Ethical Standards by making strong efforts to correct the misuse of psychological persuasion by the tech industry and by user experience designers outside the field of psychology.', 'There is more the psychology profession can and should do to protect children and rectify the harm being done to kids. It should join with tech executives who are demanding that persuasive design in kids’ tech products be regulated. The APA also should make its powerful voice heard amongst the growing chorus calling out tech companies that intentionally exploit children’s vulnerabilities.

Two icons of the quantitative analysis community have locked horns on the greatest of public stages, Twitter. You may be forgiven for not following the controversy: I’ll do a quick review for the uninitiated. All code and data used to create this article can be forked from this Github Repo.', 'Nate Silver is the co-founder of FiveThirtyEight. A massively popular data focused blog that gained fame for its accuracy predicting the outcomes for the U.S. elections in 2008. Silver generates predictions using a clever poll aggregating technique which accounts for biases, such as pollsters who only call people with landlines.', 'A trained statistician, via economics, he directed his passion for baseball (sabermetrics) and poker analytics into the arena of politics. In fact, the name FiveThirtyEight is a nod to the number of U.S. electoral votes (538 of them). However, the blog also covers other interest areas like sports. Nate sold his blog to ESPN and took the job of Editor in Chief. They (ESPN) used it as a platform to feed their audience with forecasts of sporting events, FiveThirtyEight has since moved to ABC. A routine visit to their website is greeted with a mix of political and sports articles with detailed predictions and data visualizations.', 'Nate’s forecasting prowess has become accepted as canon in the popular media. He is a routine guest on many nationally televised shows to discuss his predictions during every national election cycle. So it came as quite a shock when Nassim Taleb, a best-selling author, and quantitative risk expert, publicly announced that FiveThirtyEight does not know how to forecast elections properly!', 'For his part, Taleb has become extremely successful due to his shrewd understanding of probability in the real world. His books are both philosophical and technical, with a focus on uncertainty and risk. Specifically, he believes that the vast majority of quantitative models used in practice do not sufficiently account for real-world risk. Instead, they give the illusion of short-term value (like being accurate in some well-understood situations) but expose the unknowing users to enormous systemic risk when they experience situations the models are not designed to understand.', 'Taleb gained fame, in part, because he puts his philosophy into action by exposing his wealth. Malcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorker on how Taleb turned his philosophy on risk into an incredibly successful investment strategy. He has since gained significant wealth during unforeseen market events such as Black Monday, the Russian debt default, and the financial crisis of 2008. Taleb now spends much of his time writing and deadlifting (I’m jealous of this bit). He is not shy about telling someone publicly that he disagrees with them: One of those people is Nate Silver.', 'However, Silver isn’t taking the insults lying down!', 'Silver and Taleb, with three million and 300k followers respectively, create an enormous buzz with these exchanges (starting back in 2016). However, a quick read through the comment threads and you will realize that few people understand the arguments. Even Silver himself seems taken off guard by Taleb’s attack.', 'I think, however, this is a great opportunity for a data science professional (or aspiring professional) to dig deeper into what is being said. There are implications on how we choose to model and present our work in a reliable and verifiable way. You must decide for yourself if Taleb has a point or is a just another crazy rich person with too much time on his hands.', 'The primary source of controversy and confusion surrounding FiveThirtyEight’s predictions is that they are ‘probabilistic.’ Practically what this means is that they do not predict a winner or loser but instead report a likelihood. Further complicating the issue, these predictions are reported as point estimates (sometimes with model implied error), well in advance of the event. For example, six months before polls open, this was their forecast of the 2016 presidential election.', 'Their forecast process is to build a quantitative replica of a system with expert knowledge (elections, sporting events, etc.) then run a Monte Carlo simulation. If the model closely represents the real-world, the simulation averages can be reliably used for probabilistic statements. So what FiveThirtyEight is actually saying is:', 'x% of the time our Monte Carlo simulation resulted in this particular outcome', 'The problem is that models are not perfect replicas of the real world and are, as a matter of fact, always wrong in some way. This type of model building allows for some amount of subjectivity in construction. For example, Silver has said on numerous occasions that other competitive models do not correctly incorporate correlation. When describing modeling approaches, he also makes clear that they tune outcomes (like artificially increasing variance based on the time until an event or similar adjustments). This creates an infinitely recursive debate as to whose model is the ‘best’ or most like the real world. Of course, to judge this, you could look at who performed better in the long run. This is where things go off the rails a bit.', 'Because FiveThirtyEight only predicts probabilities, they do not ever take an absolute stand on an outcome: No ‘skin in the game’ as Taleb would say. This is not, however, something their readers follow suit on. In the public eye, they (FiveThirtyEight) are judged on how many events with forecasted probabilities above and below 50% happened or didn’t respectively (in a binary setting). Or, they (the readers) just pick the highest reported probability as the intended forecast. For example, they were showered with accolades when after, ‘calling 49 of 50 states in the 2008 presidential race correctly’ Nate Silver was placed on Times 100 most influential people list. He should not have accepted the honor if he didn’t call a winner in any of the states!', 'The public can be excused for using the 50% rule without asking. For example, in supervised machine learning, a classification model must have a characteristic called a ‘decision boundary.’ This is often decided a priori and is a fundamental part of understanding the quality of the model after it is trained. Above this boundary, the machine believes one thing and below it the opposite (in the binary case).', 'For standard models, like logistic regression, the default decision boundary is assumed to be 50% (or 0.5 on a 0 to 1 scale) or the alternative with the highest value. Classical neural networks designed for classification often use softmax functions which are interpreted in just this way. Here is an example Convolutional Neural Network performing an image classification using computer vision. Even this basic Artifical Intelligence model manages to make a decision.', 'If FiveThirtyEight has no stated decision boundary, it can be difficult to know how good their model actually is. The confusion is compounded when they are crowned, and gladly accept it, with platitudes of crystal ball-like precision in 2008 and 2012, due to the implied decision boundary. However, when they are accused of being wrong they fall back to a simple quip:', 'You just don’t understand math and probability.', 'Often this is followed up with an exposé about how they only reported x%, so that means that (1-x)% can also happen. It’s a perfect scenario; they can never be wrong! We should all be so lucky. Of course, this probabilistic argument may be valid, but it can cause some angst if it seems disingenuous. Even the Washington Post had an opinion piece which opined as much during the 2016 election.', 'What is not clear is that there is a factor hidden from the FiveThirtyEight reader. Predictions have two types of uncertainty; aleatory and epistemic. Aleatory uncertainty is concerned with the fundamental system (probability of rolling a six on a standard die). Epistemic uncertainty is concerned with the uncertainty of the system (how many sides does a die have? And what is the probability of rolling a six?). With the latter, you have to guess the game and the outcome; like an election!', 'Bespoke models, like FiveThirtyEight’s, only report to the public aleatory uncertainty as it concerns their statistical outputs (inference by Monte Carlo in this case). The trouble is that epistemic uncertainty is very difficult (sometimes impossible) to estimate. For example, why didn’t FiveThirtyEight’s model incorporate, before it happened, a chance that Comey would re-open his investigation into Clintons emails? Instead, this seems to have caused a massive spike in the variation of the prediction. Likely because this event was impossible to forecast.', 'Instead, epistemically uncertain events are ignored a priori and then FiveThirtyEight assumes wild fluctuations in a prediction from unforeseen events are a normal part of forecasting. Which should lead us to ask ‘If the model is ignoring some of the most consequential uncertainties, are we really getting a reliable probability?’', 'To expand on this further, I have consolidated some of FiveThirtyEight’s predictions, using their open source data, for two very different types of events; U.S. Senate elections and National Football Leauge (NFL) Games. Here is a comparison to the final forecast probability and the actual proportion of outcomes.', 'The sports data (NFL games) has an excellent linear relationship. These proportions are built using 30K data points, so, if we assume the system is stable, we have averaged out any sampling error. However, as you can see, there is still a noticable variation of 2–5% of actual proportion to predictions. This is a signal of un-addressed epistemic uncertainty. It also means you cannot take one of these forecast probabilities at face value.', 'Sports, like other games of chance, have very well defined mechanisms which lend themselves to statistical analysis. On the other hand, highly non-linear events, like contested elections, may not. With much fewer data points you can see the variation of the Senate predictions is enormous. Gauging the performance of models on these types of events becomes doubly difficult. It isn’t clear if a prediction is wrong owing to the quality of the model (epistemic) or just luck (aleatory).', 'One of the most troubling things about this approach to forecasting is that it opens pandora’s box for narrative fallacies. Why did Clinton lose? Comey? Email servers? People can then justify possibly spurious inferences by eyeballing events which occur around the forecast variation. ‘Just look at how the forecast is changing will all this news!’', 'I think this is what has Taleb up in arms. The blog feels more like a slick sales pitch, complete with quantitative buzzwords, than unbiased analysis (though it may very well be). If a prediction does not obey some fundamental characteristics, it should not be marketed as a probability. More importantly, a prediction should be judged from the time it is given to the public and not just the moment before the event. A forecaster should be held responsible for both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty.', 'When viewed this way, it is clear that FiveThirtyEight reports too much noise leading up to an event and not enough signal. This is great for driving users to read long series of related articles on the same topic but not so rigorous to bet your fortune on. Taleb and Silvers take on how FiveThirtyEight should be judged can be visualized like this.', 'Because there is so much uncertainty around non-linear events, like an election, it could reasonably be considered frivolous to report early stage forecasts. The only conceivable reason to do so is to capture (and monetize?) the interest of a public which is hungry to know the future. I will not go into the technical arguments, Taleb has written and published a paper on the key issues with a solution.', 'Here we can say, with some confidence that FiveThirtyEight predictions are not always reliable probabilities. However, they masquerade as one, being between 0 and 1 and all. This is Taleb’s primary argument; FiveThirtyEight’s predictions do not behave like probabilities that incorporate all uncertainty and should not be passed off as them.', 'I do not want to suggest that FiveThirtyEight is bad at their craft. They are, likely, the best poll aggregator in the business. If we only look at the last reported probabilistic forecast and use the public’s decision boundary, they are more successful than any other source attempting the same task. However, positioning yourself to appear correct regardless of the outcome, making users infer their own decision boundaries, over-reporting of predictions, and ignoring epistemic uncertainty should not be overlooked. How goes FiveThirtyEight’s reputation, so goes much of the data community’s reputation.', 'Be clear on your suggested decision boundary, probabilistic statements, assumptions about uncertainty and you’ll be less likely to misguide stakeholders.', 'All code and data can be forked from this Github repo.']"

She hangs around our combat outpost because we give her candy and hugs. She gives us flowers in return. What everyone else at the outpost knew (except for me, until that day) was that she also carried weapons for insurgents. Sometimes, in the midst of a firefight, she would carry ammunition across the street to unknown assailants.', 'According to the rules of engagement, we could shoot her. No one ever did. Not even when the First Sergeant morbidly reassured them on a rooftop in the middle of Iraq.', 'Other soldiers didn’t end up as lucky.', 'Sometimes they would find themselves paired off against a woman or teenager intent on killing them. So they’d pull the trigger. One of the sniper teams I worked with recounted an evening where he laid up a pile of people trying to plant an IED. It was a “turkey shoot,” he told me laughing. But then he got quiet and said, “Eventually they sent out a woman and this dumb kid.” I didn’t need to ask what happened. His voice said it all.', 'I often wonder what would have happened if the Flower Girl pointed a rifle at me, but I’m afraid I already know. The thought didn’t matter anyway. There was enough baggage from tours in Afghanistan and Iraq that coming home was full of uncertainty, anger, and confusion — and not, as I had been led to believe, warmth and safety.', '“People only want to hear the Band of Brothers stories. The ones with guts and gusto! Not the one where you jam a gun in an old woman’s face or shoot a kid.” I pause, then add, “Look around the room for a second…”', 'Andy surveys the restaurant we’re in for a moment while I lean in with a sardonic half-smile.', '“How many people can even relate to what we’ve been through?

Hell, I want to hear about the latte giveaway… especially if it’s pumpkin spice.”', 'This eases the tension and he smiles.', 'Andy and I feel like we don’t fit in. We met a few years ago at the church where he works, and where I volunteer. Of the thousands of people in the congregation, we are a handful of veterans.

We never readjusted to normal life after deployment. Instead, we found ourselves angry, depressed, violent, and drinking a lot. We couldn’t talk to people about war or its cost because, well, how do you talk about morally reprehensible things that leave a bruise on your soul?', 'The guilt and moral tension many veterans feel is not necessarily post-traumatic stress disorder, but moral injury — the emotional shame and psychological damage soldiers incur when we have to do things that violate our sense of right and wrong. Shooting a woman or child. Killing another human. Watching a friend die. Laughing about situations that would normally disgust us.', 'Because so few in America have served, those who have can no longer relate to their peers, friends, and family. We fear being viewed as monsters, or lauded as heroes when we feel the things we’ve done were morally ambiguous or wrong.', 'The U.S. is currently engaged in the longest running war in the history of the United States. We are entering our 15th year in Afghanistan, and we still station troops in some Iraqi outposts. In World War II, 11.5% of U.S. citizens served in four years. In Vietnam, 4.3% served in 12 years. Since 2001, only 0.86% of our population has served in the Global War on Terror. Yet, during World War II, 10 million men were drafted, and over 2 million men were conscripted during Vietnam. Despite the length of the Iraq and Afghan Wars, there has been no draft, whereas in times past, shorter wars cost us millions of young men. Instead, less than 1% of the population has borne this burden, with repeated tours continually deteriorating our troops’ mental health.', 'The gap between citizens and soldiers is growing ever wider. During WWII, the entire nation’s focus was on purchasing war bonds and defeating the Nazis. Movie previews and radio shows gave updates on the war effort. Today’s citizens, however, are quickly amused by the latest Kardashian scandal on TV, which gives no reminder of the men and women dying overseas. Because people are more concerned about enjoying their freedoms and going about their day to day lives, veterans can feel like outcasts. As though nothing we did mattered to a country that asked us to go.', 'This is part of the problem with a soldier’s alienation. People quickly point out that we weren’t forced to join the military and fight in a war. We could have stayed home. The counterpoint is that, because the U.S. has now transitioned to an all-volunteer force, those opposed to war should be thanking their lucky stars that volunteers bear the burden of combat.', 'Additionally, regardless of whether you’re Republican, Democrat, Libertarian, Communist, Liberal, Conservative, Conscientious Objector, or Pacifist, we all sent the soldier overseas. Because we live in a democracy, we vote to put men and women in charge of governing our affairs, and those elected representatives send troops overseas. We may have voted for someone else, but it does not change the fact that we’ve put ourselves under the governance of the United States. When you live in a country, you submit yourself to their governing body and laws — even if you don’t vote.', 'The citizen at home may not have pulled the trigger, but they asked the soldier to go in their place.', 'By shirking responsibility, civilians only alienate our soldiers more. The moral quagmire we face on the battlefield continues to dump shame and guilt onto our shoulders while they enjoy the benefits of passing the buck and asking, “Whose fault is it, really?”', 'On March 3, 1986, 11 years after the end of the Vietnam War, Metallica released their critically acclaimed album Master of Puppets. On the album, a song entitled “Disposable Heroes” tells the story of a young man used as cannon fodder in the midst of war, and the terror that enveloped him on the battlefield. Three years later, Metallica released “One,” a song about a soldier who lost all his limbs and waits helplessly for death. The song won a Grammy for Best Metal Performance.', 'In an odd twist, both songs are amazingly popular among members of the United States military. During my time at the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center, we had an entire platoon that could practically sing every last lyric to “One.” In Afghanistan and Iraq, these songs were on playlists made to get soldiers amped before missions. We sang songs about dying on behalf of the people or coming home a vegetable. As crazy as that sounds, we sang those songs because they felt true. And they felt true because of the conversation we refuse to have as a country.', 'As Amy Amidon, a Navy psychologist, stated in an interview regarding moral injury:', 'Civilians are lucky that we still have a sense of naiveté about what the world is like. The average American means well, but what they need to know is that these [military] men and women are seeing incredible evil, and coming home with that weighing on them and not knowing how to fit back into society.', 'Most of the time, like the conversation Andy and I had, people only want to hear the heroics. They don’t want to know what the war is costing our sons and daughters in regard to mental health, and this only makes the gap wider. In order for our soldiers to heal, society needs to own up to its part in sending us to war. The citizen at home may not have pulled the trigger, but they asked the soldier to go in their place. Citing a 2004 study, David Wood explains that the “grief over losing a combat buddy was comparable, more than 30 years later, to that of a bereaved spouse whose partner had died in the previous six months.” The soul wounds we experience are much greater. Society needs to come alongside us rather than pointing us to the VA.', 'Historically, many cultures performed purification rites for soldiers returning home from war. These rites purified a broad spectrum of warriors, from the Roman Centurion to the Navajo to the Medieval Knight. Perhaps most fascinating is that soldiers returning home from the Crusades were instructed to observe a period of purification that involved the Christian church and their community. Though the church had sanctioned the Crusades, they viewed taking another life as morally wrong and damaging to their knights’ souls.', 'No one in their right mind wants war. We want peace. And no one wants it more than the soldier.', 'Today, churches typically put veterans on stage to praise our heroics or speak of a great battle we’ve overcome while drawing spiritual parallels for their congregation. What they don’t do is talk about the moral weight we bear on their behalf.', 'Dr. Jonathan Shay, the clinical psychologist who coined the term moral injury, argues that in order for the soldier and society to find healing, we must come together and bear the moral responsibility of what soldiers have done in our name.', 'Whether you agree or disagree with war, you must remember that these are our fellow brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, flesh and blood. As veterans, we are desperate to reconnect with a world we feel no longer understands us. As a country, we must try and find common ground. We’re not asking you to agree with our actions, but to help us bear the burden of carrying them on behalf of the country you live in. A staggering 22 veterans take their lives every day, and I can guarantee part of that is because of the citizen/soldier divide.', 'But what if it didn’t have to be this way? What if we could help our men and women in uniform bear the weight of this burden we carry? We should rethink exactly what war costs us and what we’ve asked of those who’ve fought on our behalf. In the end, no one in their right mind wants war. We want peace. And no one wants it more than the soldier. As General Douglas MacArthur eloquently put it:', '“The soldier above all other people prays for peace, for he must suffer and bear the deepest wounds and scars of war.”']"

My face shield was blurred by a streaky haze. I tilted my neck back and forth in an effort to peer beyond it, beneath it, through it, whatever might work. Was it condensation? I started to raise my hands to my face to wipe it away before I remembered and yanked them back down: I cannot touch my face, can’t ever touch my face — neither inside this room nor outside it.', 'As I stood at the head of the patient’s bed in ER Room 3, her nurse, Kate, secured a mask over the patient’s face to deliver additional oxygen. I checked to ensure the oxygen was cranked up to the maximum flow rate while we waited for the respiratory therapist. Even with that increased oxygen, the patient was saturating 85% at best, and her blood pressure was dropping.', 'Ninety minutes earlier, the patient — a woman of 68 years with significant impairment from a stroke — had been fine. The nurse at her nursing home called to inform us they were sending the patient to the ER for evaluation of “altered mental status” because she was less “perky” than usual. Her oxygen level on arrival was normal with no shortness of breath. Her blood pressure was a little low, but her blood glucose read high. Nothing a little IV fluid couldn’t fix, and initially, it did.', 'I had requested a rectal temperature; it read 103 degrees. The combination of her being a nursing home resident and running a fever was a red flag during these coronavirus times. I placed her on respiratory isolation and asked Kate to be extra vigilant for any decline. I ordered broad-spectrum antibiotics to kill any likely source of infection while I awaited her chest X-ray, urine, and blood tests. Her portable chest X-ray was done first and revealed what I had already anticipated: diffuse atypical infiltrates, a presumed telltale sign of Covid-19. Although our understanding of this viral infection is ever-evolving, it seems the only observation we can reliably conclude is that we have not yet identified anything pathognomonic about it.', 'Seventy-five minutes later, another nurse, Charlene, called, “They need you in Room 3.”', '“Okay,” I replied as I entered orders on the next chest pain patient with shortness of breath.', '“Dr. Harper, they need you in Room 3 now,” Charlene called again.', '“Room 3? The nursing home patient? I’ll be right there. What happened?”', '“Her oxygen is at 67%.”', 'I asked the clerk to call respiratory therapy for intubation. I then turned back to Charlene to ask her to help Kate prepare for the procedure.', 'Then the personal protective equipment (PPE) sequence.

After removing those gloves, I donned my face shield, then walked to the cart for a new gown. Lastly, a fresh set of gloves before entering the patient’s room.', 'I was scared, and I don’t get scared. Other doctors do, but not ER doctors. We don’t scare easily.', 'Now I waited for the respiratory therapist. It was good that she needed extra time to get the ventilator and then don her PPE because I had to figure out why I couldn’t see without manually manipulating my face shield. My thoughts were pierced by the sound of panting. I checked the patient who was taking the oxygen quietly, rapidly, ineffectively at regular intervals that didn’t register a sound. Her eyes remained closed—no flip of an eyelash, no wince of her forehead, no twitch in a limb. Despite her instability, the patient was in no visible distress. No heaving breath there. The nurse to my left was concentrating on the patient’s oxygen. I heard only the crinkle of her gown as she adjusted her stance. The panting wasn’t hers. The nurse to my right prepared to administer the intubation medications. He read out my orders — the name and dose of the medication in each syringe and the order in which they were to be pushed. His voice was steady. It wasn’t him hyperventilating. The nurse just outside of the room kept documentation of the procedure on scrap paper she used to carefully transcribe each detail onto her laptop. She was too far away to be heard unless she yelled, so that audible breathing certainly wasn’t hers.', 'The panting was my own.', 'A hailstorm of thoughts ensued. Was my breath the fog on my face shield? If so, my N95 mask had a leak. Unsuspecting, had I already inhaled the virus? Would I be intubated next?', 'The respiratory therapist had arrived with the ventilator and put on her face shield. She was almost ready, so there was little time to pull myself together.', 'Breathe in, I commanded myself: One, two, three. Breathe out. I obeyed: One, two, three, four.', 'Was I already short of breath? Had I not noticed my symptoms when I drove to work this morning? Yesterday? Last night?', 'Breathe in. One two, three. Breathe out. One, two, three, four.', 'I was scared, and I don’t get scared. Other doctors do, but not ER doctors. We don’t scare easily.

Any injury to ourselves incurred in the line of duty is dealt with after we’re off the clock.', 'Once in a while, however, there are circumstances when the capacity to compartmentalize is overwhelmed, when the chronic stress breaks through so that the fear works on you. Now, as I stood at the patient’s bed with the video laryngoscope blade in one hand and the endotracheal tube in the other, panic pushed its way through me in involuntary. forceful. rapid. shallow. breaths.', 'Breathe in on one, two, three. Breathe out on one, two, three, four.', 'The respiratory therapist slapped on her gloves and in moments was at my side. It was time for intubation.', 'Breathe in on three and out on four.', 'At last, my breathing was smooth, measured, sound.', 'I looked through my mask again. It wasn’t condensation. It was streaks from the sanitizing wipes because we had to reuse our equipment.', 'I adjusted my eyes to the clear spaces. Finally I could see. My N95 mask fit. I could breathe.', 'The room was relatively quiet, what I like to call “ER calm.” All was still, save for the bagging of respiratory therapy, save for the swoosh of oxygen jetting from its port aerosolizing everything.', 'I requested that the intubation medications be administered then checked for a response. After visualizing the vocal cords easily with the video laryngoscope, I slid in the endotracheal tube, and respiratory connected it to the vent.

But when this war is over, this is why many of us will leave.', 'Doffing my gown and gloves, I put on new gloves to remove and sanitize my face shield. I couldn’t imagine there was a way to effectively clean the foam band across the forehead. I hoped to remove the streaks. I also hoped the impossible: to remove the virus, because it was the same shield I had to use repeatedly during my shift. I took off the N95. We’re now told that we can reuse it, too, numerous times before getting a new one due to the PPE shortages, so I put the contaminated mask back in the bag until I would need to don it again for the next patient.', 'This is how we get infected.

The thing is, it’s impossible to know which camp we’re in until it happens.”', 'She nodded again.', 'We smiled at each other, and I continued to the bathroom.

If he is good at something, it’s marketing and self-promotion. Calling himself “President Trump” goes beyond tradition: it reinforces the idea that he is still the President. It is another way for him not to concede and to further his Big Lie that the Democrats stole the election from him. “You don’t concede when there’s theft involved,” he told the crowd on January 6. This move is a continuation on the same line.', 'Not surprisingly at all, the Trump propaganda network (OANN and Newsmax) only uses “President Trump”, but they have shifted to using “Obama” or “Barack Obama” only, as shown in the screenshots below. This choice of words is a deliberate move to reinforce the idea that the “office of the former president” has an official capacity and that this capacity only belongs to “President Trump.”', ""The press release also states that as the former president, Mr Trump will handle official activities to advance the United States' interests and carry on the agenda of the Trump administration. Once again, the words are purposefully chosen to imbue this sham office with dignity and powers it does not have. It gives the impression to the ignorant that Mr Trump will continue representing the country, that he still has leeway to affect the legislative agenda."", 'This wording also doubles as a promise. Trump is signalling to his base that he will not abandon them, that he will “continue the fight.” Looking back at his four years in office, it is evident that Trump never had a plan beyond making himself rich, dividing the country, inciting a coup, and hurting minorities.

Lately, certain members of the Trump administration have been talking the same way about Iran, and just recently some fortuitous incidents have handed them a convenient casus belli. So this essay is for the benefit of readers for whom what’s going to happen over the next months might seem bizarre, horrific, or inexplicable if you aren’t old enough to have lived through it before, or read enough to know that it’s a syndrome with an etiology as predictable as that of any other disease. In fact, it’s one of the commonest civilizational afflictions, the equivalent of the cold, one that’s been documented since history began.', 'Here’s how this goes.', 'The government wants to attack another country. They have a real reason and an official reason. The real reason is something pragmatic, mercenary: resources (oil), strategic position, political advantage. Sometimes it’s just to help win an election at home. The official reason will be something to appeal to popular sentiment, ostensibly noble but ultimately primal: honor, revenge, race hatred, fear. It’s not really necessary that people believe this official reason; only that it be plausible enough that they can pretend to accept it. Because beneath both the pragmatic and sentimental reasons is a deeper, more primitive one: People like war. We are aggressive animals who exult in killing, and once every generation or so this instinct expresses itself in a vast spasm of tribal violence, a mass murder. We still practice human sacrifice, just with modern rationales. Though I’m sure the Aztecs thought their reasons were self-evidently reasonable as well.', 'Truth, selectively edited and cynically deployed, makes the most effective lie.', 'We’ll hear stories about the enemy’s atrocities against their own people, their oppression and torture, their sponsorship of terrorism. (Some of these stories may well be true. Truth, selectively edited and cynically deployed, makes the most effective lie.) We’ll hear about their intentions to attack us, or our allies, their secret weapons and preparations for war, very nearly ready now. There will be a sense of terrible urgency — that every day’s hesitation is dangerous, further debate tantamount to treason. In the buildup to the invasion of Iraq, the Cheney/Bush administration made much of the threat of Saddam Hussein’s “weapons of mass destruction.” There weren’t any, as it turned out. The same phrase is being used again now, with impressive contempt for the capacity of the American memory, in reference to Iran. Americans have a particular dread of nuclear weapons that goes beyond the rational, which I suspect is projected guilt at being the only nation to have used them. One Bush functionary, trying to frighten Americans into supporting her administration’s oil grab in Iraq, recited the talking point: “We don’t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.” The current administration will surely invoke the same threat, of Iran using nuclear weapons against us, or against Israel, our fellow nation of white people.', 'Obviously the usual gung-ho fuckheads will support the war — the same reliable percentage of the populace who’ll back any war the government wants to start, or anything else it wants to do to people who aren’t American (or white, or male, or straight). But you might be unpleasantly surprised at how many ostensibly well-educated people will also support it: editorialists and commentators at prestigious news outlets, not just the state propaganda network, will sound sober and considered in making arguments, honed in debate clubs, Ivy League seminars, and think tanks, for killing lots of strangers for no reason. Some of them will be eloquent and convincing. (The only difference between the St. Crispin’s Day speech and a chimpanzee scream is the rhetoric.) It turns out smart people can be just as stupid as stupid people, if they’re scared enough. They’re don’t want to be accused, as they were in middle school, of being wimps, and they secretly get just as excited at the prospect of seeing people die as any MAGA-hatted NASCAR fan. And it won’t, after all, be their kids who have to go.', 'Read Thucydides. He describes how, in time of war — the same 25 centuries ago as now — idiot recklessness becomes courage, asking questions cowardly, talking sense effete and faggy. Or take it from Hermann Göring, at one time the designated successor to Hitler. Once the gig was up, the game over, he was quite candid about how you get ordinary people to go to war for you: “All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.” (He dismissed the suggestion that it works any differently in democracies.) So you already know what to expect if you publicly oppose the war: you’ll be accused of naivete, of cowardice, of giving aid and comfort to the enemy, of supporting oppression, totalitarianism, terrorism. Proponents of war will posture as hardheaded, clear-eyed pragmatists, calculating practitioners of realpolitik, as they offer up sacrificial children to the god of death.', 'Eventually, there’s a triggering incident, some sort of attack on America or our allies. This can be real or invented; doesn’t matter. In Vietnam, the Gulf of Tonkin incident provided Lyndon Johnson congressional authorization to escalate the conflict: this consisted of two incidents in which Vietnamese torpedo boats attacked an American destroyer, except, then later, it emerged that one of them never actually happened, and the other consisted of a single bullet hole in the hull and zero casualties. By the time these facts emerged, we’d sacrificed over 50,000 American lives, and millions of Vietnamese ones. National security advisor, John Bolton, claims that our next target, Iran, is responsible for attacks on our sovereign oil tankers and pipelines in the Persian Gulf. (Bolton, incidentally, supported the Vietnam War, but unfortunately wasn’t able to attend.) Just yesterday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iran for another attack on our hallowed tankers in the Gulf of Oman. Different gulf, same story. Neither of them happened to have any conclusive evidence on them right at that exact moment, but they both seemed quite confident. Their claims may or may not be true, but it doesn’t matter; they know we won’t be able to disprove them until it’s too late.', 'The government’s spokesmen will assure us it’ll be a quick victory; that our casualties will be limited; that it won’t cost as much as its sniveling liberal critics claim. They said all these things about the war in Iraq, which resulted in sectarian violence, civil war, cascading collapse throughout the region, gave rise to ISIS, killed over 4,000 American soldiers and as many as half a million Iraqis, and cost one trillion ($1,000,000,000,000) dollars. Years later, it’ll become evident that, in retrospect, the opponents of war were right about everything, and its proponents and supporters were either liars or rubes — but it’ll be moot by then, because the war will be lost, the money squandered, and the dead forgotten, except on Veterans Day. The planners and proponents of the war may admit, grudgingly, that some mistakes were made, might call it a “blunder” (certainly not a “crime” or “atrocity”), but made in good faith — and anyway, hindsight is 20/20; there’s no point in rehashing the past, pointing fingers, or “playing the blame game.” And in a decade or two, you can do it all over again; you just have to wait long enough for a new generation that doesn’t remember the last time to come of military age.', 'Humanity, as a class, is a slow learner, partly because every new generation is starting over from total ignorance.', 'When I was a kid, the Vietnam War had recently been lost, and — I know this will sound incredible now — an anti-war comedy was the highest-rated show on television. This brief bout of national sanity was temporary: Only a few years later, America had successfully recovered from its “Vietnam syndrome.” The new narrative was that the press had lost the Vietnam War (a version of the Germans’ “stabbed in the back” theory to explain their loss in World War I), not that the Vietnamese had won it. We regained our confidence through the heroic defense of the Falklands and the glorious conquest of Grenada, victories of which the bards still sing. It’s already starting to look as if we might be recovering from our post-Iraq slump in morale, nearly ready to visit freedom upon someone else.', 'Humanity, as a class, is a slow learner, partly because every new generation is starting over from total ignorance. Writing and history can, in theory, improve our learning curve. And there are some indications that we might be haltingly learning some lessons, though that education has been expensive. Although America still thinks of itself as invincible, its military ventures haven’t actually gone all that well for the last 75 years or so. And it seems as if at least some people have noticed. It’s heartening that, as the Cheney administration was making its pro forma case for invading Iraq, tens of millions of people took to the streets all over the world to protest. Less heartening is that they went ahead and invaded it anyway — the government doesn’t need our permission — but at least all those people recognized it as a scam from the start. It took until 1967 for a majority of Americans to realize the war in Vietnam was a mistake, three years after the Gulf of Tonkin; it only took until 2005, a mere two years after the invasion, for a majority of Americans to decide Iraq was one, too. (Not quite in time for the 2004 election.) A recent poll shows that very few Americans would support a preemptive invasion of Iran — though four out of five would support a military response if Iran attacks us first. As the Gulf of Tonkin shows, such an attack is easily arranged.', 'It’s obvious that some people in our administration want very much to go to war against Iran, for motives ranging from the venal (more oil) to the superstitious (expediting their eschatological myth). Among them, interestingly, is not Donald Trump. Trump is stupid and weak and mean, a congenital liar, a racist, a serial sexual predator, and an ineradicable embarrassment to the history of this country; but it also has to be said that his administration’s body count is still relatively low. George W. Bush, who seems like such an endearing doofus now, with his second career as a Sunday painter and crush on Michelle Obama, signed off on the totally optional deaths of nearly 7,000 U.S. soldiers and uncounted (because it’s unpatriotic to count the deaths of our enemies) hundreds of thousands of Afghans and Iraqis. Trump dodged the draft in Vietnam, as did Bush, and Cheney, and Bolton: But, unlike the rest of those dedicated self-preservationists, Trump at least has the cowardice of his convictions — he seems to have little stomach for a new war. Of course, he may change his mind if his poll numbers are worrisome or impeachment seems likely. And he does like setting records.', 'Michael Herr once said, in an interview, that “war is like weather, it’s like natural disasters; it’s virtually unstoppable.” Herr, author of Dispatches, which has been credibly called “the best book… on men and war in our time,” would know more about it than I do. But who’s to say what’s ineradicable in human nature, and what’s malleable? Who would’ve thought, a few centuries ago, that slavery, which had endured since the beginning of history, would ever effectively be ended as a legal institution? The ethologist Konrad Lorenz, author of On Aggression, agrees that aggression is a primary instinct, like libido, not something that can be conditioned or socialized out of us. (As someone who was raised in a pacifist religion, I can confirm this.) Nonetheless Lorenz, who was writing in a time when the odds of a nuclear holocaust seemed like even money, was hopeful that humanity could successfully sublimate its aggressive instincts into less dangerous forms, from organized sports to humor, and survive.', 'There used to be a slogan, circa Vietnam, cribbed from Carl Sandburg: “What if they gave a war and nobody came?” I sometimes hope we might be inching our way toward a historic turning point where leaders crank up the reliable old machine — the propaganda campaign, the bogus casus belli, the demonization of a foreign enemy and discrediting of war opponents, the contrived triggering event — and a majority of the populace just doesn’t buy it. Politicians in this country used to be able to reliably win elections by race-baiting, gay-bashing, or invoking the specter of “class warfare” or socialism; the old battle cries are losing their power. Some generation has to be the first, when the government calls on us to put partisan politics aside, rally around the flag, Support Our Troops, to remain seated and say: Nah.']"

The townspeople watched as barracks went up, surrounded by barbed wire and chain link fences, and wondered what, exactly, they were in for. Americans had only been in the war for a year when POW camps were being built, and residents of Huntsville had little time to prepare for the reality of thousands of Nazi prisoners taking up residence just eight miles from the town limits.', 'In fact, the United States entered the prisoner of war business very reluctantly in 1941, and then only at the insistence of the British. The Allies were winning the North African front of the war, and capturing soldiers they could not house. The British wore down the United States after months of efforts and a few frosty notes from Whitehall. “It is very hard to understand on this side why…it should prove so difficult even to get an agreement in principle,” complained one frustrated writer. The U.S. begrudgingly accepted their share of POWs in 1942, starting with 50,000 soldiers from the African front.', 'POW camps would spread out across the country in subsequent years, throughout the South, Southwest and Midwest, cropping up in California, New Jersey, West Virginia, and North Carolina. By the time the war ended, about 500,000 captured soldiers were housed in the United States, and 380,000 of those were German prisoners of war.', 'Huntsville was the first camp to open, built from scratch and fully outfitted to comply with Geneva Convention requirements for warm and hygienic living quarters, access to medical treatment, provisions for libraries and other intellectual activities, and open spaces that encouraged physical activities. Prisoners also had to be housed in a climate similar to where they were captured, which was why so many captured in North Africa ended up in Texas.', 'By the time they arrived at Camp Huntsville, the German POWs were thrilled. They’d already been dazzled by travelling to the prison in luxurious Pullman cars. Both the cityscapes and the rural beauty of the United States amazed them. “From New York to Texas, you saw the whole countryside. Cars driving. Buildings lit up….I came to wonder — how did we ever think we would beat the U.S. at this war?” former POW Heino Erichsen mused decades after the war ended.', 'Men like Rudolf Thill, who was transported to Huntsville in 1943, found sparkling facilities behind the chain link fences and rows of barbed wire. Enlisted men lived in bunk rooms. Officers had their own quarters. They ate food that the townspeople could only dream of during rationing, with items like milk, meat, and butter appearing on their daily menus. Angry local residents dubbed the camps “The Fritz Ritz.”', 'At first, locals weren’t just resentful, but also feared the prospect of Nazi prisoners of war in their towns. Former prisoners of war remember Americans searching their faces, “looking for horns,” expecting the moral menace of the German soldiers to even manifest physically. Americans who gathered to gawk at the prisoners as they were transported across the country also expected to see a race of superhero-like men, blonde, muscular, tanned, and fearsome examples of men Hitler described as a “master race.” They were disappointed. “To our curiosity and surprise, they looked no different than other young men in the neighborhood,” a 14-year-old boy observed at the time.', 'The resentment passed quickly when the federal government decided, in 1943, that it would be safe to put the Nazi soldiers to work. Farmers had been complaining they couldn’t find anyone to work their fields. Most men were expected to fight in the war and for those who were left behind, the war-related industries paid far better than farm work. Farmers were thrilled to hire the prisoners to hoe and pick cotton. For the most part, the walls between the locals and the prisoners dissolved as soon as the Germans picked up hoes. Grateful farmers invited POWs to lunch and showered them with small gifts of candy and cigarettes. “They were just the best bunch of boys,” one Texan recalled.', 'American officials were frustrated by their inability to stop their citizens from fraternizing with the enemy after the walls between the prisoners and the townspeople came down (albeit metaphorically). Women lined up against the chain link fences to watch the POWs play soccer. People piled into train stations when a transport was scheduled to arrive, hoping for a glimpse of the prisoners. Edouard Patte, a Swiss delegate of the International YMCA who worked as a Red Cross monitor, put it this way: “it’s difficult to imagine that these nice blond lads with rosy cheeks had been war baiters and murderers a short while ago.”', 'The POWs also found friends in the most unlikely of places, as they worked alongside African Americans hoeing and picking cotton, talking away long days in the hot sun. African American field hands were painfully aware that white Americans treated Nazi prisoners far better than they did people of color. African Americans waited on POWs when they were transported in Pullman cars to their camps, and prisoners were also allowed to eat in whites-only cafeterias. At the camp, they were dealt the most menial jobs, including spraying the prisoners with delousing foam. The slights hurt all the more because African-American soldiers fought diligently during WWII in all-black units such as the renowned Tuskegee airmen.', 'Yet, on an individual level, they got along with the Germans. And Germans were fond of them, in part because African American soldiers had protected them from the mobs of people who wanted to kill the POWs.', 'Surprisingly, given the blatant racism of the Nazi party, some of the German soldiers were also shocked by the shoddy treatment of their fellow farmworkers. “The blacks…didn’t do much better than us,” remarked one POW. “They were just in front of the wire, and we were behind the wire.” Another German soldier, who was a farmer in his civilian life, noted that African American were expected to pick two to three more times the cotton required of the POWs. “You have to see how they lived,” he said after the war. “These people were so exploited.”', 'At the time, Huntsville was conducting a re-education program for German prisoners, and the status of African Americans made Germans look askance at their classes on the land of the free. “They were being taught the meaning of ‘democracy,’” explained historian Matthias Reiss, “while outside the southern camps no black citizen dared to step on the sidewalk alongside white Americans.”', 'As part of their re-education, prisoners were also showed films of Allied soldiers liberating the concentration camps. “We saw the emaciated bodies and empty eyes of the survivors,” said POW Gerhard Hennes. “We saw the piles of naked bodies, starved to death. We saw the mass graves. We saw the ovens where tens of thousands had been cremated. We saw and stared in silence, struggling but unable to believe what we Germans had done to Jews, gypsies, prisoners of war and many others deemed inferior or expendable.”', 'They watched them in disbelief, and many refused to accept the truth of what they saw. “This just doesn’t happen,” former POW Herman Daumling recalled thinking as he watched the films. “Nobody does that.” The fact of concentration camps was an open secret, but German soldiers claimed that no one knew about the genocide that claimed the lives of 6 million Jews and 5 million others that the Nazis deemed undesirable. Listening to American radio news reports eventually convinced Daumling that the films weren’t propaganda, but unvarnished truth, but he was the exception. Fewer than half believed that the Holocaust was real by the end of the war, according to a poll conducted by the U.S. government.', 'Accepting the fact of the death camps had profound consequences for German soldiers. Hennes was one of the believers. “I turned in one profound transformation from being a hero to being a villain,” he said.', 'Thousands of German POWs moved back to the United States after the war, including Hennes. Historian Arnold Krammer estimates that 8,000 POWs eventually returned to the U.S. Some married American women, but most were sponsored by a resident to be eligible for residency, including former farmers supporting their former farm hands. POWs who didn’t immigrate to the States still visited Texas regularly for reunions with the farmers they once worked for. “Without exception, they recall their years as POWs in Texas as ‘the greatest times of their lives,’” Krammer observed.', 'Erichsen also moved to the United States after the war, eventually becoming a citizen and settling in Texas. He’s lived here most of his life. Yet he can’t shake what he learned as a young person. He still remembers the songs he had to memorize as a young man in Nazi Germany. He offered a few lines to a reporter reluctantly, at his wife’s urging: “Sharpen the long knives on the lantern post. See the Jewish blood flow.” He doesn’t want to think about what he learned as a child, but he has acknowledged it is a part of him, and he can never relax his vigilance against the hateful indoctrination of his youth.']"

His name was Basil al-Assad.', 'The first son was so beloved by his father that the president was fond of being called Abu Basil, which translates as “Father of Basil.” As heir apparent to his father, Basil’s sudden violent death was a shock to the family, and a stunning blow to the future of the nation and its people. The second son was never intended to be a leader. He was off in London, training to be an eye doctor.

Bashar’s murderous reign raises a peculiar question: How many hundreds of thousands of Syrian people died because of that one car accident?', 'If you catch news of the Syrian conflict, it seems like a narrative that’s knotted and frayed, impossible to untangle. However, it’s not, if you pull on the right thread.', 'When the world learned that the Syrian government––under orders from President Bashar al-Assad––had (allegedly) dropped bombs of sarin gas on its own people, the news reports defied easy understanding. How could any leader do that to his own people? But if you know the story of Syria, this atrocity is sadly quite predictable. It follows a historic pattern.', 'To understand why Bashar al-Assad exterminates his own people, you must understand how Bashar values the people of Syria. His people. But before they were his people, they belonged to someone else. To understand the son, one must know the father. The story of the Syrian conflict — a tale of staggering losses of human life, death on a scale that avoids comprehension— is a war story that’s not easy to tell. There’s the factions. The history. The layers of conflict. But, if you wish to answer the question: Why is Syria hell on Earth––why have 320,000 innocent human beings been murdered––to answer why such atrocities occur despite history’s warnings, to get at this story properly, one must start with the father of Basil, and Bashar, and the republic of Syria.', 'His name is: Hafez al-Assad.', 'Syria is a nation born from an act of European betrayal. It was part of a great betrayal of Arabs by the British and French that traces back to one man, T.E. Lawrence. You may know him from his movie biopic, Lawrence of Arabia.', 'In the film, Peter O’Toole beautifully pines as he gazes out at those bleak desert landscapes, framed by the genius of David Lean. As the audience, we see how Lawrence, an eccentric Englishman, is sent to an undesirable outpost to aid the Arabs in their fight against the Turks. They’re hopelessly outmatched. But Lawrence inspires them with the promise of freedom in victory. He even fights side-by-side with the Arab rebels he commands in battle. Together, they achieve stunning victories against the Turks. But then, once the Turks are beaten, Lawrence learns that the British government, along with the French, intends to go back on its promise to the Arabs. The land they fought, bled, and died for, will not be theirs; instead, the European powers declared themselves the new imperial overlords of the Middle East. That’s a world class betrayal.', 'After the smoke cleared, the dust settled, and the blood dried in the killing fields of World War I, there sat the ruins of the Ottoman Empire. The Turkish empire was vast. In order to divide up their prize of the newly-liberated Middle Eastern kingdoms, the British and the French designated two mapmakers––men whose names are written in the history books as cartographers but were essentially imperial bureaucrats––and tasked them with the opportunity to draw new borders across lands and peoples they did not understand. It was called the Sykes-Picot Agreement. A lattice of borders was laid over the Middle East with all the care of a blind tailor. When they were done, the former Turkish-controlled lands of the Ottoman Empire were renamed as new nations. You know them as: Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan, and Syria. (Armenia was also freed from Turkish domination, but was given to the Russians.)', 'The new nations were never intended to be independent. They were intended to be colonies for the European powers. Of course the Arab natives of the region weren’t super eager to trade their old Ottoman overlords for new French ones. The people rightfully wanted nations of their own, not puppet governments, ones loyal to a foreign power. They’d fought and died to establish Arab republics. Which is why, in 1925, before the newly-minted State of Syria could celebrate its first birthday, rebel factions began a civil war against the French-mandated Syrian government. The rebellion was led by a man named Sultan Pasha al-Atrash.', 'The rebel leader Sultan al-Atrash and his followers were from a minority ethnic group in Syria, the Arab Druze people. They lived mostly by the southern border with Palestine. As tribal leaders, al-Atrash’s family had ruled this section of land since the 1870s. When the French replaced the Turks as the foreign power, the Druze refused to accept the new French Mandate. They made war against this so-called State of Syria. They’d just fought the Turks to be free. Why not the French? Plus, the Druze had largely been left out of the new power-sharing agreement between the city-states of Aleppo and Damascus. The revolution led by al-Atrash was immediately popular with other tribes in Syria, it spread like a wildfire of insurrection, lasting for two years. It burned across the countryside. But the Arab rebellion overlooked the obvious fact the French military had a brutal technological advantage. Remember, this is just after World War I.', 'So, what do you think the French military used to put down the revolts?', 'Imagine bi-planes flying over population centers packed with Arabs. It was an indiscriminate campaign of death from above. During one campaign the French air force bombed the civilians of Damascus, for 48 straight hours, murdering rebels and civilians alike. Indiscriminately. Which is how, inevitably, al-Atrash’s popular revolt was quashed. All Syrians were punished, guilty and innocent.', 'But the French took seriously the message of Arab discontent. They promised the Syrian people change. Real Arab leadership. A Syria for Syrians. Oui, Oui!', 'Their plan was doomed by another tribal oversight. The French largely ignored the third major ethnic group in the Syria, the Alawites, a Shiite Muslim tribal group native to the northern coast, up by the border with Turkey. The tribe had strongly objected to the French Mandate and never officially joined the State of Syria. As a minority ethnic population, just like Sultan al-Atrash and the southern Druze tribe, the Alawites had been left out of the French plans for a power-sharing agreement that saw the city-states of Aleppo and Damascus as the seats of Syrian power.', 'Quick note, this will pop back up later in our story: the al-Assad family are Alawites. If you’re keeping score, the Alawites are a Shiite ethnic group, or tribe, in a predominantly Sunni Muslim nation. This fun fact from the nation’s founding will forever affect the story of Syria. You may also notice another pattern and theme begin to shape Syrian history. Can you guess what it is?', 'Here, I’ll give you a hint: bombing civilians.', 'Fast-forward five years. It’s 1930. For reasons wholly political, a new new nation of Syria is declared. It’s called the Syrian Republic. At this point, Syria is becoming born-again faster than a Mississippi divorcee. And again, the people’s dream of a truly independent Arab-ruled Syria is rejected. Instead, the nation is given a new set of window dressings, put up by the latest version of a puppet French government. (The French are nothing if not stubborn.)', 'In 1936, there are new talks for a treaty of independence from France. The Syrian Republic––and all its various peoples––will finally be free to found a sovereign Arab nation. Free to set their own course. Free from the domination of foreign rulers. And one year later, in 1937, a free and independent Syria is established. But it’s never fully legalized. The French legislature decides not to ratify the treaty. Which leaves the young nation in limbo. It’s left as an unrecognized nation, about as legit on the world stage as a Disney family fun island.', '*record scratch*', 'By the way, notice something important about the years we’re talking about? There’s an external tension galloping along with Syria’s internal tensions. Remember what else was going on in the world in the late 1930s? If so, you may guess what happens next. That’s right….Boom!', 'World War II.', 'When the Nazis march on Paris and take over France in 1940, the occupied government of Vichy France is left in charge of the colonial French-mandated puppet government of Syria. Which means, for a short while, the Syrian Republic is governed by Nazi-occupied France. Essentially, the Nazis. Yet another new foreign power in charge of Syria. But then, the war in the European theater ends in the summer of ‘45, and the restored French government promises to pull out of Syria. The newly-liberated French claim they will finally allow the Arab nation to become a truly free and independent nation, no longer under rule by a foreign power. And, one year later, when the French still haven’t left Syria, new popular uprisings and protests break out.', 'In May of 1945, the Prime Minister of the Syrian Republic, Faris al-Khoury travels to San Francisco to attend the founding conference for the United Nations. He presents a proposal that outlines why Syria should be granted its freedom from the old League of Nations-approved French Mandate of Syria. Meanwhile, back in Syria, the French Air Force is bombing the country, to convince them to accept restored French rule. On October 24, 1945 the United Nations is born with the ratification of the UN Charter. Syria was a founding member state of the UN. With the establishment of the UN, its predecessor the League of Nations and its agreements such as the French Mandate of Syria are no longer legally binding. Which Syria declares is the perfect opportunity for their independence from their French overlords.', 'Based on what we know of the story of Syria, so far, how do you think the French responded to the Prime Minister al-Khoury’s pleas to the UN to recognize Syria as a free and independent Arab nation?', 'You know the answer: violence against innocent Syrians. The French fired artillery into the crowds of protesters. They shut off the electricity in Damascus. Their warplanes continued to indiscriminately bomb civilians.', 'But after they put down the latest rebellion, the French had a change of mind. Busy rebuilding France after the devastations of World War II, the French had their own headaches and hassles to deal with back home. Constantly putting down insurrections in a colony was becoming too expensive and unpopular. In 1946, the French decide to cut Syria loose. And on April 17, 1946 the last French troops leave Syria. The nation will, finally, be free and independent.', 'However, yet again, external politics intervene. In 1948, a new nation is born on Syria’s southern border. Its birth will reshape the entire Middle East region. And it spells immediate trouble for Syria. You know that new nation as….Israel.', 'To the south and west of Damascus is an area called the Golan Heights. It’s down there in the lower left corner of Syria. It was part of the old border with Syria’s southern neighbor Palestine. But when the Arab nation of Palestine was annexed and designated by the United Nations as a Jewish homeland, Syria is drawn into a fresh conflict with its new neighbor, Israel.', 'In 1948, Syria joined with other Arab nations, who’d vowed to crush Israel. Together they waged all-out war. And together, they lost. Spectacularly. One year after the beginning of the war, in July of 1949, Syria quit fighting their new neighbor. They were the last ones to put down their arms. Their loss against Israel was a crushing humiliation. In fact, it’s such a colossal embarrassment it leads to a coup. The first of many coups, new constitutions, and reformed cabinets. This settles into a pattern––for a decade and a half, Syria is a roiling cauldron of governmental upheaval.', 'At one point, in 1958, Syria attempts to join with Egypt to create a super-nation, the United Arab Republic. They dream of one giant Arab nation spreading across the Middle East, like a Muslim superpower, a union of federated republics. But, like all dreams, it’s short-lived. In less than three years the United Arab Republic crashes hard on the rocks of reality. In 1961, Syria attempts to become, once again, a newly free and independent nation. They call their new nation the Arab Republic of Syria. Which leads to a new governmental instability. In March of 1963, the Arab Socialist Ba-ath Party takes over Syria in a coup d’état.', 'Eventually, we arrive at an end to all this tumultuous chaos. Finally, strong Arab leadership comes to Syria. So strong that it ends the cycles of inner turmoil and constant domination by outside nations. Finally, Syria overcomes the push and pull of world events. Out of chaos comes the birth of a new and lasting order. It’s the last and most important coup.', 'So, who do you think led that coup?', 'Ten points if you said: Hafez al-Assad. AKA Abu Basil, father of Basil, Bashar, and Syria.', 'Hafez al-Assad made his first power moves after Syria lost to Israel in a yet another failed war. The year was 1967. Hafez al-Assad was the Minister of Defense for Syria during the Six Days War. As Col. Hafez al-Assad he mostly stayed out of the struggles for power that resulted from the loss to Israel. Of course, Hafez had opinions, but he saw himself as a military man. The sort who takes orders. As the Minister of Defense, there were many in the military who respected him. As did many politicians. His opinions shaped Syrian policy. Which meant, he also had political rivals. His key rival was the Salah Jadid, the President of Syria. After al-Assad discovered an assassination plot against him masterminded by the sitting president, he decided it was time for him to go full gangster, and just take over the whole operation.', 'In November of 1970, the government under President Jadid convened an Emergency National Congress. It was called to settle down the growing crisis of confidence in his leadership. Feeling threatened by his popular Minister of Defense, President Jadid was eager to sideline Hafez al-Assad. His plan was to use the Emergency National Congress to very publicly remove al-Assad from any and all official government posts he holds. It’s a common move when one fears a coup from the military. All the top leadership of Syria attended the Emergency National Congress. But Hafez al-Assad rolled up like a gangster. One who had his own army. When he arrived at the Emergency National Congress, he ordered his most loyal troops to surround the building.', 'Inside, the meeting goes down as planned. President Jadid stripped al-Assad of all his official government positions. Thoroughly shamed, the president and his allies feel convinced this public embarrassment will effectively sideline the former Minister of Defense. And if they’re lucky, it might salt the earth for any future political ambitions. How wrong were they? They totally failed to realize who they were dealing with. Hafez motherfucking al-Assad.', 'Once the Emergency National Congress was concluded, al-Assad declares himself in-charge of Syria, and confidently orders his troops to arrest President Jadid and his key supporters, and anyone who opposes his new leadership. In a very un-democratic move, al-Assad seized control of the whole damn country. His loyal soldiers didn’t even have to fire a single shot.', 'After Hafez al-Assad’s bloodless coup was a total success, everyone in Syria gets the message. And they get in line. Finally, there’s some order and stability. It comes in the form of an authoritarian leader. But there is no doubt Hafez al-Assad is the undisputed leader of Syria, a stabilizing force, and would remain so for the next thirty years.', 'Now, to make things a little more interesting, keep in mind, the al-Assad family are Alawites. Remember they’re the same tribal group that wouldn’t originally partner with the city-states of Aleppo and Damascus way back when the newly-formed French-mandated nation of Syria was first negotiating its various independence deals with France after the end of World War I. That’s how far back these tensions go. Unresolved tensions from World War I. And the religious tension are far older than that. Since al-Assad is a member of the Shia minority group of Alawites, to maintain his tight grip on leadership, as the supreme leader of Syria, he often acted with crushing violence to suppress any uprisings in the Sunni-predominant urban centers, such as Damascus and Aleppo.', 'When you hear about people living in a Syrian city such as Damascus, Aleppo, or Homs, you might think they’re all the same. They’re all Syrians. You have to keep in mind these are groups of people from different historic ethnic groups. Aleppo and Damascus aren’t just cities in Syria. They were ancient, independent city-states. As Americans, we might think of them as two neighboring cities like Cleveland and Cincinnati. But it’s more like if Cleveland and Cincinnati were once fierce rivals, and then one day, some foreigners with guns and bombs came along, drew a line around them all, called it a border, and said they now live in Ohio. This is important but often overlooked aspect of life in Syrian cities. The cities are ancient rivals.', 'Right about now you may be wondering, “But wait, where is America in this story? When does the U.S. show up in this tale?”', 'At the end of World War II––much like at the end of World War I––there were two new superpowers, only this time it was America and the Soviet Union. The world entered its post-colonial period. All around the globe, new nations popped into existence. Either through war and revolution, through mandate, or sometimes through royal decree. But for three decades, nations constantly stepped free of the grip of their former colonial rulers. As the countries emerged from European rule, the new nations often had to pick, either, the U.S. or the Soviet Union as their strategic ally. In return, the two competing superpowers used the new nations as sites for their proxy wars. This is how the Middle East became a patchwork of Soviet and U.S.-alliances.', 'Never one to miss a trick, Hafez al-Assad exploited regional politics and Cold War politics to his benefit. With Soviet weapons, al-Assad turned Syria into a feared and respected Arab republic. One that was a worthy military rival to its southern neighbor, Israel. But that fight would have to wait, because there was a new threat spreading in the Middle East, one that pitted Muslim against Muslim. The militarized political arrangements of the Seventies –– and the hopes for peace in the Middle East, that seemed so near at hand after President Carter, Menachem Begin, and Anwar Sadat struck a peace accord between Egypt and Israel –– drew to a sudden and surprising close at the end of the decade. It was like someone had turned on all the lights in the disco. The culprit was Iran. Iran turned on the lights in the disco. But that’s what you do when your thing is Islamic fundamentalism.', 'The year was 1978, when a theocratic movement of students and religious clerics united to overthrow the American-backed Shah of Iran, every leader in the Middle East turned their head to watch, wondering if they could be next, as the Ayatollah urged all Muslims to reject Western powers and embrace Islamic fundamentalism, to adopt religious values as the guiding voice for politics in the region. That was a direct challenge to Hafez al-Assad, who was the secular socialist president partnered with the atheist Soviet Union, who was actively at war against Muslims in Afghanistan. Not a good look for an Arab leader when everyone’s talking theocracy. And you know al-Assad will suppress the first signs of rebellion or revolt; if he detected the faintest whiff of protest it would be met with state violence. Because, never forget, al-Assad is an Alawite, which means he is a Shia Muslim who’s the leader of a majority Sunni nation. This is what anyone would call a crisis of leadership. But Hafez al-Assad had seen it coming. Since 1976, he’d been putting down his own Islamist uprising in Syria.', 'After four years of him waging sectarian violence against the Syrian Sunni fundamentalists, backed by the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, the revolts against al-Assad metastasized into full-on assassination attempts. In 1980, there was a nearly successful attempt on al-Assad’s life that did succeed in scaring him into responding with increasingly horrific violence. The embattled president put his brother in charge of a counterinsurgency with one goal: crush the Sunni Islamist revolt.', 'In 1982, al-Assad ordered the siege of the city of Hama. For 27 days, the Syrian government pummeled the civilians of the city with artillery attacks and waves of aerial bombings. When they finally stopped, the Syrian government had killed 20,000–40,000 thousand of its own citizens. (The number of fatalities depends on whose count you use.) Around the world, the Hama Massacre was widely-criticized, it was a shocking atrocity. But the revolt was put down. The Hama Massacre was one of the most heinous acts an Arab government ever committed against its own people. Does it sound kinda familiar though?', 'Now, let’s jump forward ten years.', 'It’s 1991. There’s a war brewing in the Persian Gulf. America led by George Bush the Elder is about to take on Iraq in the First Gulf War.', 'Can you guess who secular, socialist, Soviet Union-backed, President al-Assad and his Syrian government chose as their ally in the Gulf War?', 'Just like he did in the Iran-Iraq War in 1980, Hafez al-Assad, leader of the socialist Ba’ath party of Syria, decides to help a foreign power fight and defeat the Ba’ath party of Iraq. He stuns the world and sides with a western power, America, and aids its attacks on a majority Muslim nation.', 'After the First Gulf War ends, al-Assad is still in power, and now he’s a little less worried about a fundamental Muslim revolution deposing him. The Americans are now the ones to attract their fundamentalists’ anger and incur their violence. But he’s also still feeling a bit unprotected. He was about to lose his biggest ally. That same year, in December of 1991, al-Assad and the rest of the world watched as the Soviet Union dissolved like a sugar cube in the rain.', 'How could al-Assad negotiate the new political reality and retain power in Syria? His options were limited. He could become an unofficial American ally, like Egypt had done. But the risk there was that it might turn him into a puppet in the eyes of his people, and spell doom for his leadership like it did for the Shah of Iran. What about the Muslim nation to his north, Turkey?', 'For many readers Turkey’s role in the Middle East may be something of a question mark. Like, what’s the deal with Turkey in the Middle East? Are they part of it, or not? Turkey exists at the physical divide between Europe and Asia. It’s a gateway nation, which makes it’s an impossible country to read. It’s a nation with two faces. It looks one way to Westerners. And quite different to Easterners, like Iran or Russia. And, Turkey looks quite different to the Arab world. The eyes of their culture see further back in history. To Arab eyes Turkey conjures up memories of centuries of domination by the Ottoman Empire that only ended thanks to the bloodshed of World War I. And now, a century later, memories of Turkish domination are not forgotten, or forgiven. To this day, no Arab nation wishes to see the return of a dominant Turkey. Which means, Syria, like all its other Arab neighbors, will always avoid partnering with Turkey.', 'So, who can a socialist, religiously moderate, secular nation like Syria partner with to help them remain a free and independent country? While also avoiding the ever-present threat of a hostile takeover by the fundamentalist Islamic wave that burns like coals all across the Middle East, always ready to flare up and start a new bonfire of resistance?', 'To buy himself time, all throughout the Nineties, al-Assad plays diplomacy games with the West. He makes overtures that much like Egypt did, Syria will make peace with Israel. He works high level political calculus,and all the while al-Assad drags his feet through round after round of international negotiations and discussions about the planned peace deal and new treaty with Israel. President Clinton and the West especially want al-Assad’s help and stamp of approval on an Israel-Palestine solution. America thinks there can one day be peace in the Middle East. This idea al-Assad dangles like bait before the West, but he never formally confirms anything. He plays the West.', 'Just as he has done for decades in his dealings with the West, al-Assad employs stalling tactics in his negotiations, and soon enough, he finds he has a new ally. One that’s perfectly suited to keep the West from strong-arming him, and protect him from losing power to the Islamist fundamentalist. His new ally was an old friend.', 'From the ashes of the Soviet Union, had emerged a new nation, one weaker than before, but bound together by a ruthless form of gangster-capitalism. They call the new nation the Russian Federation. Thanks to the fact they’re natural and historic allies, Syria partnered with the new Russia. This move kept regional powers like Iran in check. It also kept the regional powers like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, who are both majority Sunni populations, along with the gulf states of Abu Dhabi, Qatar, and Dubai, from dominating the region with the backing of the Americans. And remember, the Americans are, for the most part, just an update on the former colonial powers, the British and the French. Which, like the Turks, no Arab nation wants as their foreign ruler. Plus, by partnering with Russia, it makes arch-rivals Israel, and Turkey, think twice about ever messing with Syria. On the geopolitical chessboard it’s a brilliant move to make. It’s exactly what you expect from a political gangster genius like Hafez al-Assad: wait for the world to change.', 'Over the last 100 years, since, roughly, 1920, Syria has partnered with the French, the Nazi-occupied French government, the British, the Americans, the Egyptians, the Iranians, the Soviets, and most recently, the Russians. For a hundred years, they’ve struggled to be a free and independent nation that sets its own destiny. To do that, they’ve had to play global politics. Which means they’ve played the dark and dirty games of the region, riding waves of violence as they ceaselessly ebbed and flowed, ever since the Ottoman Empire crumbled at the end of World War I.', 'As a nation, Syria began as two dominant city-states, Damascus and Aleppo, grouped together with a number of various ethnic tribes, most notably, the two tribal states, the Alawites in the north, and the Druze in the south, all forced together by foreign map-makers and their colonial bosses. The one man to hold power in Syria, supreme leader Hafez al-Assad, from the Alawite minority, is a strongman who always felt the only way for him to hold onto power in a majority-Sunni nation, with majority-Sunni nations for neighbors, was to periodically wage indescribable acts of violence against the citizens of his own nation. To defeat outsiders he chose to kill Syrians. At this point, you could cynically call it a family tradition.', 'To understand why, in 2017, President Bashar al-Assad gassed his own people, and has bombed the city of Aleppo into a post-apocalyptic wasteland, you need look no further than his father. That’s his blueprint.', 'First, the people living in the city-state of Aleppo are not al-Assad’s people. Bashar may be the leader of Syria, but his people, his father’s people, are the Alawite tribe from the north. The people in Aleppo are Sunnis. To Bashar, he’s killing enemies, not his people. The Syrian revolution began in 2011. One of the first and largest anti-Assad protests was in the city of Hama. Bashar responded with tanks. By the time his men were done suppressing the protest, they’d killed two hundred civilians. It was called the Siege of Hama. Which mirrors his father’s Hama Massacre. This is just what the family does to hold power.', 'Secondly, President Bashar al-Assad is and will always be battling against the same fundamentalist Muslims his dad had to quash. In one form or another, they’re the same ones that have been trying to overthrow the Syrian government since the mid-Seventies. That’s commitment. The Muslim Brotherhood and its allies would still love to see a fundamentalist Sunni leadership in Syria. The Iran Revolutionary Guard would also love to see a fundamentalist Muslim leadership in Syria, only difference is they’d prefer it be led by Shia Muslims, not Sunnis like the Muslim Brotherhood. And, of course, there’s ISIS. Each fundamental Islamist group imagines it differently, but they share the same general goal: religious revolution. Bashar al-Assad firmly believes the only thing holding back these various flavors of Muslim fundamentalism is the constant reminder of the pain of death.', 'Thirdly: There’s Russia. Vladimir Putin enjoys fulfilling the role of the former Western colonial powers. For one, it’s lucrative for Russia to sell weapons and arms to Syria. The Syrian conflict also gives Russia a place to run military exercises. It’s a powerful means for Putin to project dominance on the world stage. And, most importantly, Syria is an arena for Russia to challenge the presumption that the old colonial powers––the British and the French, and the new ones, the Americans, who back the Saudi Arabians and the gulf states––are the real power in the region. Putin doesn’t agree with that assumption. The Syrian civil war is a monkey wrench the Russians can throw into Arab regional relations, and into world politics. Bashar al-Assad learned from his dad this global game-playing amongst the world powers is how one retains power in Syria. You leverage outsider power to control your own people.', 'Syria is not a free and independent nation. It has yet to achieve that goal. And the people pay for that failure. Millions of innocent people, unfortunate to have been born in Syria, must live in the murderous intersection of tribalism, religious and sectarian divides, proxy warfare by foreign powers, and wartime capitalism. Their lives are unfairly marred by the original sins of Turkish and subsequent European colonialism. Their supreme leader, President Bashar al-Assad, is just the latest symptom of a devastating disease. He’s playing a role not written for him, and thus he does the only thing he knows works: be as vicious and cunning as dear ol’ daddy, Hafez.', 'History doesn’t repeat, but it does rhyme. This may be why Syria remains a bloody cluster-fuck. There’s no end in sight because no one is working on the sources of the tensions. Instead, well-meaning outsiders are overwhelmed by the endless cycles of violence, even if they’re occasionally motivated into action by the pitiful looks on the faces of helpless children. The people doomed to live in Syria lack the ability to overcome all of these various forces working against them. Survival is their best hope. Hell, they just tried to wage a revolution for their freedom from tyranny. You see where that got them. The last 7 years have been the government’s answer. Plus, it’s not like America’s going to do any serious and committed nation-building guided by the tiny hands of Donald Trump and his under-staffed and under-funded State Department. And, the Russians? Well, we all know they aren’t known for spreading democracy. There is no peaceful escape for the people from the murderous reign of Bashar al-Assad.', 'The only person who’s successfully held power in Syria was a socialist gangster military mastermind from an ethnic minority. Who do you think the eye doctor son who accidentally became president after his older brother died in a car crash is going to emulate? The story of his father, Hafez, sheds light on an ugly truth: for the foreseeable future, with Russia’s backing, Bashar will guarantee that Syria remains bloody as a slaughterhouse killing floor.', 'How many hundreds of thousands of lives were lost because of that one car accident? Big brother Basil may not have been a better president, but it’s difficult to picture he would’ve been more monstrous than his little brother Bashar. But, who knows? Basil may have tried to surpass his father’s cruelty, and he may have exceeded Bashar’s civilian-killing ways. That’s not the best question to ask. The only good and important question to ask is:', 'What can possibly save the people of Syria from this endless cycle of violence that’s as predictable as the sweep of the arms of a murderous clock?', 'In other words, when will Syria finally be a free and independent nation? Right now, America and Russia continue to bomb hospitals in Syria, as they try to defeat ISIS. Meanwhile, the Russians aim to keep Bashar al-Assad in power, while the Americans give aid to the rebels looking to depose him, the same rebels that are aligned with the latest fundamentalist Sunni Islamists, ones you know best as…Al Qaeda. That’s right. In Syria, America is uneasy partners with Al Qaeda. That’s Syria.', 'And that’s been Syria for the last 100 years. That’s why refugees are desperate to leave, the same ones President Trump has banned from entering the U.S. The same refugees that drown in the Mediterranean, desperate to reach Europe. The West drew the imaginary lines in the sand that created Syria. That original betrayal of Arabs by the West is the reason why Syria became hell on Earth. It’s easy to ignore the truth of that statement if you blame Bashar and Hafez al-Assad for the bloodshed we see in the news.', 'But now you know…that’s not the real story.', 'The real story is far uglier.']"

At today’s UN Security Council Haley gave remarks about why the UN should “take action” against two of the US power establishment’s favorite targets, Russia and the Syrian government, due to allegations that Bashar al-Assad has been using chemical weapons.', 'That’s right, just three weeks after the Trump administration unveiled its plan to keep thousands of US troops in Syria in order to force regime change, the tired old chemical weapons allegations have been unearthed and recirculated to trusting western mainstream media audiences.', 'I am not a Syria expert by any stretch of the imagination. If you want detailed information about what’s really going on in that nation I recommend getting in touch with real Syrians online and following the work of independent investigative journalists who regularly go there like Vanessa Beeley. Nevertheless, despite my lack of boots-on-the-ground expertise and intimate knowledge of every detail of what’s going on in that country, I am absolutely certain that the western power establishment is lying very extensively about what is going on in Syria.', 'One hundred percent certain, zero margin for error. I’d bet my life on it.', 'How can I be so sure? I’ll show you.', 'There are many, many, many piles of evidence substantiating the fact that the Syrian government has become the target of what is surely one of the largest and most sophisticated propaganda campaigns in human history, but most people don’t have time to comb through all the tiny details and sort through the complexities of what’s what. For this reason I thought it would be useful to compile a short list for people who, like me, don’t have time to dedicate themselves intimately to the in-depth study of Syria. This list makes it abundantly clear that there is an organized disinformation campaign saturating mainstream narratives about what is happening in Syria, making it therefore impossible to place any faith in the reports that are coming out about that nation’s government today. All you need is a little information and critical thinking.', 'Without further ado, here are five reasons why you can be as absolutely certain of the mass media’s deception in this area as I am.', 'I point to this one a lot. If you haven’t yet figured out that mainstream media outlets are tools of outrageous war propaganda, and you watch this interview with your eyes wide open, your jaw will drop to the floor and you will never see the world the same again.', 'After the highly suspicious and hotly disputed accusations of sarin gas use by the Syrian government in the Idlib province back in April of last year, a little girl was paraded before the CNN audience to condemn Assad and plead for western intervention. Anyone watching the interview can see that it is very obviously scripted, and the little girl is sounding out pre-written syllables in a way that children simply do not speak, using words and concepts that no seven year-old could possibly understand. This is self-evident to anyone who doesn’t have a vested interest in not seeing it.', 'Additionally, other video footage from around the same time showed that the girl did not speak English enough to even understand basic questions about what kind of food she likes to eat, instead regurgitating the pre-scripted line “Save the children of Syria” in response.', 'More disturbingly, because this interview was scripted, it means that CNN’s Alisyn Camerota necessarily had the other half of the script the girl was reading from. A prominent newscaster from a top US mainstream media outlet knowingly participated in a fake, scripted interview designed to manufacture support for western military interventionism, and sold it to CNN’s audience as a real interview.', 'The footage from that fake interview was then re-used by CNN to bully congressman Thomas Massie for his opposition to Syrian interventionism.', 'Bana and her popular Twitter account have been propped up by countless establishment backers ranging from Time Magazine to Harry Potter author JK Rowling, as well as a lucrative book deal with Simon & Schuster. Her legitimacy has also been ferociously defended by Bellingcat, a neocon propaganda outlet with ties to the Atlantic Council, the same think tank whose Ukraine-tied influence has fingerprints all over the establishment Russia narrative. Bellingcat and its sleazy staff have been loudly sounding the alarm about the new “chemical weapons” story throughout online media.', 'Similar to item number one, independent researcher Robert Stuart has shown conclusively how the world’s oldest and largest broadcasting organization, the BBC, aired a documentary containing footage meant to implicate the Assad government that anyone looking can recognize as clearly fake.', 'In a presentation for Media on Trial, Stuart breaks down part of the BBC documentary Saving Syria’s Children showing clear and undeniable evidence that the footage which purports to show victims of an Assad napalm bombing has been staged and faked from top to bottom. The presentation is packed with information and the the 19-minute clip is definitely worth watching in its entirety, but for me the real clincher comes at around the four-minute mark after Stuart explains what burn victims tend to look and behave like, and he simply turns the sound off on the video footage and replays it with the question “just ask yourself, is this real?”', 'It isn’t. Plainly it isn’t. Watch it and see for yourself; it’s as fake as the Bana Alabed interview.', 'It can be hard to catch propagandists in the act in a clear and undeniable way, but these are two irrefutable examples of the top outlets in both the US and the UK airing blatantly deceitful disinformation to manufacture support for military interventionism. You can say that this doesn’t mean every single thing western media reports has been deliberately and deceptively manufactured in the same way, and that’s fair… but you also can’t say there’s any good reason to go believing them, either. If the propaganda effort is that pervasive that it’s airing brazen military psyops at the very top echelons of western media, you simply cannot trust anything they say about Syria. The fact that a known compulsive liar could technically be telling the truth about something at any given moment is not a legitimate reason to place your trust in him.', 'This one is a rabbit hole and a half, and I cannot possibly list all of the countless pieces of evidence here against the so-called “Syrian Civil Defense” aka the White Helmets, but let me try and sum it up.', 'Whenever you hear about a new Assad atrocity, the original source of the report is this extremely shady organization with extensive ties to both terrorist groups and western warmongers. Here’s a new article from the Washington Post, originally from Associated Press, advancing the narrative in the headline that “Syrian activists” are reporting a chlorine gas attack. Read the article, and guess who those “Syrian activists” turn out to be? White Helmets.', 'You can spend days and days researching this one (and some people have devoted their lives to exactly that), but just to get at the basics of this high-level manipulation, here is a video showing footage and testimony connecting the White Helmets to violent extremist groups, and here is an article with an assortment of supporting articles detailing the organization’s funding from the US, the UK and the EU as well as its ties to Al Qaeda. In this illuminating interview Vanessa Beeley even goes so far as to say that the White Helmets are literally just Al Qaeda members who put on white plastic headgear when they want to film propaganda to advance their agendas.', 'Once dismissed as a baseless conspiracy theory, it is now a known and admitted fact that the US has been arming terrorist factions in Syria to advance its regime change agendas. Utilizing extremist groups is one of the many ways the US-centralized war machine has found to get around the resistance of the American people to participating in new wars with US boots on the ground; they enlist the help of violent terrorist factions to attain their bloodthirsty goals. This is a known fact. Is there any reason to resist the notion that they’d enlist those groups in fabricating psyops as well?', 'Consortiumnews recently ran an essay by Rick Sterling titled “WMD Claims in Syria Raise Concerns over U.S. Escalation” discussing the US war machine’s extensive history of using lies, propaganda and false flags to manufacture support for military interventionism. Sterling discusses the flimsy grounds for the basis of the current anti-Assad narrative being rammed down our throats today, and reminds us simply that we have been here before, beginning his essay with the words, “It’s the WMD story all over again.”', 'The Iraq invasion was less than fifteen years ago, and now we’re being scaremongered about a brand new evil dictator in the same region, right next door to Iraq, who also happens to have a great love of acquiring and using WMDs. According to a new report by Reuters, citing anonymous officials as sources, there is now a risk of those weapons of mass destruction coming “to US shores”.', '“It will spread if we don’t do something,” the official warns in the Reuters report.', 'Come on, people. Think harder. We’ve done this exact dance before, and not even that long ago. They lied to you then, and they are lying to you now. If the Iraq invasion didn’t permanently shatter your trust in this schtick, it should have. But it’s not too late to fix that. Look at this thing critically and stop swallowing their swill.', 'The propagandists focus on chemical weapons because there’s nothing else they could accuse the Assad government of doing that the US war machine doesn’t do constantly. They can’t accuse him of merely killing civilians with bombs, for example, because the US does that every day. If Nikki Haley tried telling the UN that there was simply too high a civilian death toll in Syria and Russia’s bombing campaigns, the rest of the world would just say “Oh really? America doesn’t like civilians dying in air strikes anymore? Because we’ve all been meaning to talk to you about that…”', 'As noted by Max Abrams, “Assad has strong incentives not to use chemical weapons again whereas regime change supporters have every incentive to say he did.” The leverage he’d be giving people like Nikki Haley to draw the wrath of the world down upon his head by committing internationally reviled war crimes would make it nonsensical for him to use an inefficient weapon like chlorine gas. It would be strategically disastrous, it wouldn’t profit him any, bombs work much better, and his consistent denial of using those weapons (both inside Syria and outside) would invalidate any small advantage he might get from sending a scary message to his enemies.', 'Add to this the fact that some places these weapons are alleged to have been used are not only packed with his own civilians but his own soldiers as well, and you’re looking at a completely absurd story.', 'If you really think about it, the only way to believe the establishment Syria narrative is to believe that Bashar al-Assad has an actual, literal sexual fetish for committing war crimes on his own people. Not only that, but you have to believe he only developed this bizarre, previously unknown sexual kink in the last few years. That’s the only way this notion that he’s been gassing his own civilians willy nilly can possibly make any sense at all.', 'Which is more likely? That, or the same establishment that lied to you about Iraq lying to you about Iraq’s next-door neighbor?', 'Believing the establishment Syria narrative is indefensible.

As the drums of war beat louder than they have in years, Carlson stared right into the camera and did the exact opposite of what every mainstream US pundit is doing right now: he told the truth.', 'He told the truth about Syria. He told the truth about Yemen. He told the truth about the alleged chemical weapons attack in Douma. He told the truth about the bipartisan war machine which drops all pretense of opposition the instant it’s time for bloodshed. He told the truth about what war is, what it costs, and what it does to our world.', 'He stood in stark, unequivocal opposition to the trajectory the Trump administration appears to be moving along. And he did it on Fox News.', 'I have a deep and abiding hatred in my heart for Fox News and all things Murdoch. I will never forget nor forgive the key role the Murdoch press played in deceiving our world into the unimaginable evil that was the Iraq invasion. But if I’d held a reflexive rejection of anything with the Fox News logo in the corner, I never would have seen Carlson’s epic monologue, never would have shared it with my social media following, never would have embedded it in this article, and this bright flash of truth would have been diminished by that much in the impact it was able to have on public consciousness.', 'And I know that there are many leftists who declined to help spread awareness of that Carlson monologue based solely on the fact that he’s a conservative pundit on a conservative network who has said things they disagree with in the past. This is stupid. We should be able to throw any weapon at all at the war machine, not fight with one hand tied behind our backs just because we don’t like conservatives.', 'Check out the comments from my lefty followers when I shared the clip. Look how astonished they were to hear a clear voice on this issue coming from the right. Being willing to share useful weapons against the war machine lets in that much more light. Why would we want to deprive ourselves of such weapons in a fight to oppose what could very well end up being a third and final world war? If someone from an opposing ideology organizes an anti-war march or puts together a video debunking a war narrative, why deliberately halve its influence and impact at such a crucial time?', 'I always get raked over the coals when I say this, but god dammit I’m right: when it comes to important issues where our interests converge, we need to be absolutely shameless about collaborating with people on either side of the ideological divide.', 'Gateway Pundit‘s Cassandra Fairbanks and I stand on opposite ends of the political spectrum on many issues, but when it comes to crucial matters like this we are in total agreement. I reached out to her for comment when I saw her making the same argument I’m making here from the other side of the divide, urging her conservative followers to be willing to collaborate with leftists against this war.', 'Fairbanks provided the following statement:', '“We can squabble all we want about domestic policy, but none of that will even matter if nations with nuclear capabilities decide to flex their power. The establishment Democrats and Republicans in DC have already united to make this a potential reality. If the anti-establishment right and left don’t, temporarily, do the same to loudly oppose this then we are as guilty as they will be. We have to remember that our friends and neighbors, people we interact with every day, have different political ideologies. The people on Twitter and at protests are those same people. I really hope for a momentary ceasefire in our Twitter wars to prevent a real one.”', 'I agree with and co-sign every word of this.', 'Whenever I bring this up I get lefty echo chamber cultists shrieking at me that people like Fairbanks are alt-right/Nazis (which is absurd and ridiculous) and saying that the left and right don’t need to work together on any issue at all; that the left can just do its own separate, fully segregated thing on its own side of the divide while any anti-war right wingers can do their thing far away somewhere else.', 'Which of course is brilliant: let’s divide ourselves up into echo chambers where we are completely isolated from anyone who disagrees with us about anything, and launch our protests against World War Three from in there. And let’s be honest, these people won’t just stop at cutting off conservatives; most of them will cut off leftists like myself who are open to interacting with them as well. They’ll wedge out anyone who doesn’t have the correct opinions about Bernie Sanders, about trans issues and sex workers, about this or that conspiracy theory, about DemExiting vs DemEntering, until they’re all fragmented up into little impotent sects with no hope of ever launching any of their ideas into mainstream consciousness. Nobody does vitriolic sectarianism like the left.', 'For that reason we also need to stop attacking each other. People keep telling me I need to denounce Glenn Greenwald for advancing the mainstream narrative about chemical weapons and Bashar al-Assad, despite the fact that he’s been consistently and aggressively opposed to western interventionism in Syria. We don’t have that kind of luxury, people. We don’t have the luxury of rejecting anyone who’s willing to stand against the war machine, let alone a fellow leftist with a large and influential voice. We need all the help we can get.', 'I stand with anyone who will oppose the assault on Syria, a nation long targeted for regime change due to its resources, strategic location, and the ambitious agendas of its leader, as well as its refusal to bow before Israel in its border dispute over the illegally occupied Golan Heights.', 'I don’t care if you oppose a war while still believing the fairy tale that Assad is a baby-gassing Dracula. I don’t care if you only oppose interventionism because it will allow jihadists to eliminate the nation’s Christians and exacerbate the refugee crisis. I don’t care if you only oppose war in Syria because you hate anything Trump does. As long as you oppose this attack on an already brutalized nation which could lead to a third and final world war, we’re on the same side on this issue, and I’ll proudly fight the war machine shoulder-to-shoulder with you.', 'This obviously doesn’t mean compromising on our values one iota or abandoning our ideological principles. It just means when Tucker Carlson delivers a lucid anti-war monologue, we help it go viral. It means if Cassandra Fairbanks helps organize an anti-war demonstration, we go and add our voice to it. We can still work to advance all the other important issues that we are passionate about while working side-by-side against this one world-endangering threat.', 'The culture war games were fun for a while, but playtime’s over. We are staring down the barrel of events which could lead to a direct military confrontation between NATO forces and Russia and its allies; you don’t get any more points if you can “trigger the libs” or make a viral tweet mocking a conservative pundit.

Politico reports:', 'The May 17 memo reads like a crash course for a businessman-turned-diplomat, and its conclusion offers a starkly realist vision: that the U.S. should use human rights as a club against its adversaries, like Iran, China and North Korea, while giving a pass to repressive allies like the Philippines, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.', '“Allies should be treated differently — and better — than adversaries. Otherwise, we end up with more adversaries, and fewer allies,” argued the memo, written by Tillerson’s influential policy aide, Brian Hook.', 'With what would be perfect comedic timing if it weren’t so frightening, Iran erupted in protests which have been ongoing for the last four days, and the western empire is suddenly expressing deep, bipartisan concern about the human rights of those protesters.', 'So we all know what this song and dance is code for. Any evil can be justified in the name of “human rights”.', 'In October we learned from a former Qatari prime minister that there was a massive push from the US and its allies to topple the Syrian government from the very beginning of the protests which began in that country in 2011 as part of the so-called Arab Spring. This revelation came in the same week The Intercept finally released NSA documents confirming that foreign governments were in direct control of the “rebels” who began attacking Syria following those 2011 protests. The fretting over human rights has occurred throughout the entirety of the Syrian war, even as the governments publicly decrying human rights abuses were secretly arming and training terrorist factions to murder, rape and pillage their way across the country.', 'We’ve seen it over and over again. In Libya, western interventionism was justified under the pretense of defending human rights when the goal was actually regime change. In Ukraine, empire loyalists played cheerleader for the protests in Kiev when the goal was actually regime change. And who could ever forget the poor oppressed people of Iraq who will surely greet the invaders as liberators?', 'In 2007 retired four-star General Wesley Clark appeared on Democracy Now and said that about ten days after 9/11 he learned that the Pentagon was already making plans for a completely unjustified invasion of Iraq, and that he was shown a memo featuring a plan to “take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and, finishing off, Iran.”', 'So it’s an established fact that the neocons have had Iran in their crosshairs for a good long time.', 'This is all coming off the back of the nonstop CIA/CNN narrative being advanced that Iran is a top perpetrator of state-sponsored terrorism, which is just plain false. I have a lot of Trump-supporting followers, and I would like to stress to them that the group of intelligence veterans who authored this memo about Iran is the same group who released a memo dismantling the bogus Russiagate narrative; these are good people and you can trust them. I encourage you to read it.', 'consortiumnews.com', 'Trump is lying when he says Iran is “the Number One State of Sponsored Terror”. This is the same exact script they run over and over and over again, and people are falling for it again like Charlie Brown and the football. It is nonsensical to believe things asserted by the US intelligence and defense agencies on blind faith at this point, especially when they are clearly working to manufacture support for interventionism in a key strategic location. In a post-Iraq invasion world, nothing but the most intense skepticism of such behavior is acceptable.', 'Luckily, because a full scale invasion of Iran would be far more costly and deadly than the invasion of Iraq, support for this will need to be manufactured not just in America but within an entire coalition of its allies. This will be extremely difficult to do, but by God they are trying.', 'Please keep your skepticism cranked up to eleven on this Iran stuff, dear reader, and be very loudly vocal about it. My Trump-supporting readers especially, I implore you to think critically about all this and look closely at the similarities between the anti-Iran agenda and the other interventions I know you oppose.

They asked that I share their voice with the world; frustrated voices which have not been heard due to the false, one-sided biased reports pushing a narrative that supports this regime change war at the expense of Syrian lives.', 'I heard testimony about how peaceful protests against the government that began in 2011 were quickly overtaken by Wahhabi jihadist groups like al-Qaeda (al-Nusra) who were funded and supported by Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, the United States, and others. They exploited the peaceful protesters, occupied their communities, and killed and tortured Syrians who would not cooperate with them in their fight to overthrow the government.', 'I met a Muslim girl from Zabadani who was kidnapped, beaten repeatedly, and raped in 2012, when she was just 14 years old, by “rebel groups” who were angry that her father, a sheep herder, would not give them his money. She watched in horror as masked men murdered her father in their living room, emptying their entire magazine of bullets into him.', 'I met a boy who was kidnapped while walking down the street to buy bread for his family. He was tortured, waterboarded, electrocuted, placed on a cross and whipped, all because he refused to help the “rebels” — he told them he just wanted to go to school. This is how the “rebels” are treating the Syrian people who do not cooperate with them, or whose religion is not acceptable to them.', 'Although opposed to the Assad government, the political opposition spoke strongly about their adamant rejection of the use of violence to bring about reforms. They argue that if the Wahhabi jihadists, fueled by foreign governments, are successful in overthrowing the Syrian state, it would destroy Syria and its long history of a secular, pluralist society where people of all religions have lived peacefully side by side. Although this political opposition continues to seek reforms, they are adamant that as long as foreign governments wage a proxy regime change war against Syria using jihadist terrorist groups, they will stand with the Syrian state as they work peacefully toward a stronger Syria for all Syrians.', 'Originally, I had no intention of meeting with Assad, but when given the opportunity, I felt it was important to take it. I think we should be ready to meet with anyone if there’s a chance it can help bring about an end to this war, which is causing the Syrian people so much suffering.', 'I return to Washington, DC with even greater resolve to end our illegal war to overthrow the Syrian government. From Iraq to Libya and now in Syria, the U.S. has waged wars of regime change, each resulting in unimaginable suffering, devastating loss of life, and the strengthening of groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS.', 'I call upon Congress and the new Administration to answer the pleas of the Syrian people immediately and support the Stop Arming Terrorists Act. We must stop directly and indirectly supporting terrorists — directly by providing weapons, training and logistical support to rebel groups affiliated with al-Qaeda and ISIS; and indirectly through Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States, and Turkey, who, in turn, support these terrorist groups. We must end our war to overthrow the Syrian government and focus our attention on defeating al-Qaeda and ISIS.', 'The U.S. must stop supporting terrorists who are destroying Syria and her people. The U.S. and other countries fueling this war must stop immediately. We must allow the Syrian people to try to recover from this terrible war.', 'Thank you,', 'Tulsi']"

The reason for this is pretty simple: the more I learn about our world, the less interested I am in writing about nations. What interests me is writing about the nationless group of oligarchs that uses governments as tools and weapons to facilitate its various agendas.', 'I focus on the US government because that happens to be the largest and most influential tool of that nationless oligarchy at this time, but it’s ultimately only ever to draw attention to the arm which wields it. Some very powerful people figured out long ago that you can rule far more effectively when you’re unseen in the shadows than you can seated on a throne with a crown upon your head. For this reason these plutocratic elites are often like the wind: you can’t see it, but you can see its effects. America is a tree I often point to to show how the wind blows. Perhaps an even better tree for this purpose is Syria.', 'A brilliant new article has been published by Zero Hedge that I’d like to direct your attention to, because everyone on earth should read it. The article shows how an interview with former Qatari Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani constitutes a high-level “public admission to collusion and coordination between four countries to destabilize an independent state, [including] possible support for Nusra/al-Qaeda” from the very beginning of the conflict in 2011.', 'It’s interesting that in the above rush translation Prime Minister Thani says “we were fighting over the lady, and now the lady is gone and we are still fighting” to describe the various groups which gathered with the goal of toppling the Assad government, whereas Zero Hedge’s translator asserts that a better translation is “fighting over the prey”. As a woman I find it interesting not only because the meanings of “lady” and “prey” are so disturbingly interchangeable here, but also because the international convergence upon Syria has long reminded me of a gang rape, for which either word would suffice.', 'What else am I supposed to picture when told of how the United States, along with Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey collaborated with the help of Jordan to ship arms to jihadist factions from the very beginning of the Syrian conflict with the goal of overthrowing Assad? When Israel has launched repeated military strikes on the Syrian government and its allies within its borders? When the most esteemed mainstream news outlets in the US and UK are promoting the following blatant war propaganda psyops to manufacture support for further military intervention in that nation?', 'The article then points out the recent Intercept publication of a document it’s been suspiciously holding onto for years revealing that a “rebel” attack on Damascus “was directly supplied and commanded by Saudi Arabia with full prior awareness of US intelligence.” It discusses the CIA’s arming of known terrorist factions and the memo Hillary Clinton received acknowledging Qatari and Saudi support for ISIS in the region.', 'Gang rape. This is gang rape.', 'Why though? Why did this happen? Why have such diverse nations been conspiring from all over the world against a nation with a population lower than Florida? What percentage of Americans or Britons were waking up every morning in 2011 thinking “My government should really help overthrow Bashar al-Assad”? Pretty much zero, I’m certain. The public didn’t begin supporting Syrian interventionism until the talking heads on TV started telling them it was about rescuing children, like in the propaganda videos featured above. These manipulations have nothing to do with the will of the people or the governments meant to serve them.', 'This all makes sense when you stop thinking in terms of nations and governments and realize that multinational corporations and banks have no borders and are not loyal to any government. Money is power, and moneyed interests have investments in the crucial strategic region that Syria happens to occupy. The ruling elites don’t see Syria’s borders, and they certainly don’t see the Syrian people; they see profit and geopolitical influence which will go to the power structures in Russia and China if they don’t secure it for themselves. So they use the governments they control, whose borders and people they also don’t see, to secure it.', 'Or at least, they try to.', 'I’m titling this article “The War On Syria Can Show You What’s Happening In Our World”, and the takeaway is not that what’s happening is an unbeatable cabal of elites conquering and manipulating until our species snuffs itself out via climate chaos or nuclear holocaust. The takeaway is that these creeps are very beatable. The elites who rule over you are the same elites who failed in Syria.', 'The propaganda campaign against the Syrian government has failed. The plutocrats did not succeed in manufacturing the necessary public support for more aggressive intervention in that nation, which they need in order to act without provoking unrest and risking damage to their power structure and domestic investments. This meant that Russia’s involvement in the Syrian conflict would be able to keep Assad in power and restore the region to stability, which is why Putin is a high priority target in the deep state’s crosshairs now. Despite occasional comments from scumbags like Rex Tillerson, there is a general consensus that Assad will likely be staying in power, displaced Syrians will continue to return home as peace prevails, and the nation will continue to rebuild.', 'A sweet and simple Activist Post article by Brandon Turbeville titled “On Returning From Syria: More Convinced Than Ever Western Media Narrative Is Bullshit” describes the discrepancies in what we’re told about Syria vs. what’s actually happening there, and it concludes with the following interaction:', 'Later on, in discussions with a Syrian man, the question was asked how Syrians seem to be able to get back up on their feet and start living again, sending their children to school, working, rebuilding even as the war continues two miles away. The answer was simple: “This is Syria.” When it was suggested that the Western powers do not understand the Syrian connection to their country and their unmatched resolve to continue living and rebuilding what was lost, he agreed.', '“That’s right,” he said. “They don’t understand us. And that is why they lost.”', '— — —']"
