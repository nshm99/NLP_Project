\xe2\x80\x9cYour \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99 is more important than your \xe2\x80\x98IQ.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d
That\xe2\x80\x99s one of the lessons Julian Mantle learned from the Himalayan sages he sought out after selling his Ferrari and quitting his seven-figure career as a lawyer post stress-induced heart attack.
Mantle isn\xe2\x80\x99t real \xe2\x80\x94 but Robin Sharma is. Sharma worked as a litigation lawyer until he was 25. He was wealthy, successful, and miserable. In an attempt to free himself from society\xe2\x80\x99s shackles of power and status, he wrote a book about a fictional character who came back from the Himalayas to teach the real Robin what he\xe2\x80\x99d learned about life.
That book became The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari \xe2\x80\x94 a million-copy bestseller. It\xe2\x80\x99s written as a conversation between Mantle and Sharma \xe2\x80\x94 and the former has plenty of advice on happiness and purpose for the latter.
Here are 3 lessons about what really matters in life.
When Mantle gets to the Himalayan mountains, a yogi named Raman tells him a fable. The fable takes place in a garden full of beautiful, fantastic-smelling flowers. It\xe2\x80\x99s a calm, restorative oasis \xe2\x80\x94 a place you can go to in order to restore your energy at any time.
Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be great if your mind was also a place like that? Sadly, for most of us, our mind looks more like a dumping ground \xe2\x80\x94 full of clutter, needless information, and ungrounded worries.
That\xe2\x80\x99s why the first value in the Sivana system is this: Control your mind. Recognize that it\xe2\x80\x99s your job to decide what makes it into your brain\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful garden in the first place. You\xe2\x80\x99re its guardian, standing at the gate, choosing who and what makes it through.
The yogi taught Mantle a simple exercise to improve his guarding ability: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Heart of the Rose.\xe2\x80\x9d He gave him an actual rose and told him to simply stare at its center in a quiet place. Then, Mantle should fill his mind with thoughts about how beautiful the rose is.
This is a simple form of meditation. You\xe2\x80\x99re trying to direct your thoughts towards a singular, focused end. At first, your mind will send you countless distracting ideas, but the more you practice, the better you\xe2\x80\x99ll get.
The only way to control your mind is to control what goes in and comes out. Practice discipline in which thoughts you allow yourself to have, and turn your mind into the beautiful, invigorating garden it should be.
At one point in the yogi\xe2\x80\x99s story, a sumo wrestler appears. Sumo wrestlers are the epitome of self-improvement. They call it \xe2\x80\x9ckaizen.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s an ancient, Japanese concept that means \xe2\x80\x9cnever-ending improvement.\xe2\x80\x9d
The idea is to never stop learning, to always get better \xe2\x80\x94 even if it\xe2\x80\x99s in small steps \xe2\x80\x94 and that growth is just a perpetual part of life. Unsurprisingly, growth is also another virtue in the Sivana system.
Mantle learned a ten-step morning routine from his teachers, a routine that covers all the self-improvement you\xe2\x80\x99ll ever need. It\xe2\x80\x99s called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ten Rituals of Radiant Living.\xe2\x80\x9d I tried to sort the steps in a way that allows you to do them chronologically after you wake up:
A good morning leads to a good day. Good days add up to a good life.
Later in the yogi\xe2\x80\x99s story, the sumo collapses. He reawakens to the smell of some beautiful, yellow roses in the garden. These roses represent another virtue: selflessly serving others. This ancient Chinese proverb captures it:
A trace of fragrance always remains on the hands that present you with roses.
When you help someone else, something good will come back to you. You won\xe2\x80\x99t know when and how, but karma always does its thing. That\xe2\x80\x99s why in his post-law career of helping the world\xe2\x80\x99s greatest leaders, Sharma always says:
\xe2\x80\x9cGive out what you most want to come back.\xe2\x80\x9d
You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to join the Salvation Army to do good. Small acts of kindness and compassion in your daily life are just as powerful. Every morning, take a few seconds to think about what good you can do today.
Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s calling your grandma or praising a coworker, it\xe2\x80\x99ll bring you one step closer to what Mantle\xe2\x80\x99s yogi would call an enlightened life.
The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari is a self-help classic telling the story of fictional lawyer Julian Mantle, who sold his mansion and Ferrari to study the seven virtues of the Sages of Sivana in the Himalayan mountains.
It\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful metaphor that shows us true self-improvement rests on only three things:
\xe2\x80\x9cEverything is created twice \xe2\x80\x94 first in the mind and then in reality.\xe2\x80\x9d
