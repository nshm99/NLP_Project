Rachel Hollis is problematic AF. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t know, according to Wikipedia: \xe2\x80\x9cRachel Hollis is an American author, motivational speaker and blogger. Her first self-help book Girl, Wash Your Face \xe2\x80\x94 since its release in February 2018 \xe2\x80\x94 has maintained a spot in the top 10 best-selling books in the country for seven months, held the top spot for 12 of those weeks and has sold more than 880,000 copies in the United States. It was the second-most popular book of 2018 on Amazon.\xe2\x80\x9d
In a short video, Hollis refers to a livestream were she mentioned a \xe2\x80\x9csweet woman\xe2\x80\x9d who comes to her house to \xe2\x80\x9cclean the toilets.\xe2\x80\x9d Many commenters reacted and told Hollis she was \xe2\x80\x9cprivileged AF\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cunrelatable.\xe2\x80\x9d
Perhaps taking her own advice and not apologizing, Rachel acknowledged her privilege, but Hollis made the situation worse by not only calling herself \xe2\x80\x9cunrelatable,\xe2\x80\x9d but also mentioned the names of other women (mostly women of color) she found \xe2\x80\x9cunrelatable\xe2\x80\x9d just like her, including Harriet Tubman, RGB, Oprah, and Frida Kahlo. And, blaming her team for her various blunders.
\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let Rachel Hollis fool you with \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to be relatable.\xe2\x80\x99 After a year of intense public discourse on race, privilege, and systemic oppression, she chose to use her platform to peddle the myth of meritocracy and pander to her target market: whiteness and privilege,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote writer and podcaster Jen Kinney.
I can thank both my parents for the fact that I don\xe2\x80\x99t look down on other people. My dad introduced me to a lady in poverty with AIDS in the 80s who was patient of his and it profoundly changed my life to see the obstacles she had to go through. My mom always talked to everyone as they were equals from attorneys to the cleaning lady at the mall.
Various members of my family have had a housekeeper on occasion, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve always thought of it as a convenience thing and not \xe2\x80\x9cwe work harder than you\xe2\x80\x9d. I hope Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s housekeeper quits.
\xe2\x80\x9cRachel Hollis might be able to afford a housekeeper bc she \xe2\x80\x98gets up at 4am and works her ass off every day\xe2\x80\x99, but I can almost guarantee that housekeeper does the same thing \xe2\x80\x94 but for multiple houses a day and they\xe2\x80\x99ll never become a CEO,\xe2\x80\x9d Carly Button shared on Twitter.
If I could talk about this comment and the intersection of class and race, I would be here for days. Rachel is definitely the type who would own slaves if she could.
Most of my success is in large part of my parents\xe2\x80\x99 success and less to do with \xe2\x80\x9cworking harder\xe2\x80\x9d. Because of them, I could afford a good education because they had the money to do so. If my life had been different, my path would have been different. It is not to say people can\xe2\x80\x99t work hard to achieve their dreams, but if you are privileged, it\xe2\x80\x99s easier. I hate toxic \xe2\x80\x9chustle culture\xe2\x80\x9d.
Her first book, Girl, Wash Your Face, has been criticized for glorifying \xe2\x80\x9chustle culture\xe2\x80\x9d, which illustrates a lack of understanding systemic oppression. \xe2\x80\x9cWorking harder\xe2\x80\x9d is a myth and only could be true in a world where everyone was coming in at the same footing. It needs to be noted that marginalized individuals have to work even harder to achieve success. Many people of color are in situations beyond their control and can\xe2\x80\x99t even afford the $1800+ to attend one of Rachel\xe2\x80\x99s personal development seminars, so the words and thoughts are hollow.
The same book shares harmful content such as fat-shaming and the general idea that you can simply choose to be happy, without any acknowledgment of mental and physical health issues causing those effected believe that anyone who is \xe2\x80\x9cunhappy\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cunsuccessful\xe2\x80\x9d is this way because of lack of personal responsibility. That is the lie.
Rachel was born in the one of the poorest communities in Kern County, California and has described her childhood as traumatic, including a brother who took his own life. As it seems, Rachel may not have been born into wealth, but by merely being a white, heterosexual, able-bodied, cis-gendered woman she is affordable privilege many people will never have. She moved to Los Angeles after graduating high school and got a job at Miramax where she met her soon-to-be ex-husband Dave Hollis. Dave was working as director of new business development for The Walt Disney Company. My guess is Rachel wasn\xe2\x80\x99t pulling herself up by the bootstraps.
Rachel is the epitome of toxic white feminism and white supremacy tied in a pretty bow \xe2\x80\x94 it praises the liberation of middle-class cishet white women, while never taking in account the rights and needs of marginalized communities.
When Rachel says she\xe2\x80\x99s unrelatable, perhaps she\xe2\x80\x99s telling us who she is.
