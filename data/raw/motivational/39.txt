Self-talk was once seen as something reserved for motivational gurus\xe2\x80\x94perhaps you remember the SNL character Stuart Smalley staring into a mirror and proclaiming: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m good enough, I\xe2\x80\x99m smart enough, and doggone it, people like me!\xe2\x80\x9d But more people are learning that there are practical, measurable benefits to adopting a positive inner narrative. On Medium, Alan Trapulionis lays out the latest research on self-talk\xe2\x80\x94and it\xe2\x80\x99s enlightening.

Psychologists have only seriously begun analyzing self-talk in the last couple of decades, and here\xe2\x80\x99s what we know:
1) Positive self-talk improves performance in most sports.
2) Questions like \xe2\x80\x9cWill I do this?\xe2\x80\x9d produce better results than statements like \xe2\x80\x9cI will do this.\xe2\x80\x9d
3) Using \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d in self-talk is better than using \xe2\x80\x9cI.\xe2\x80\x9d
4) Talking about yourself in third person is more effective than talking in first person.
5) Both motivational (\xe2\x80\x9cI will do this!\xe2\x80\x9c) and instructional (\xe2\x80\x9cSee the target\xe2\x80\xa6straighten elbows\xe2\x80\xa6lock onto target\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9c) self-talk seems to be effective in enhancing performance.
Trapulionis describes another form of self-talk: reminding yourself that you\xe2\x80\x99re already the person you want to be and now you just need to do the actions. During Hell Week, the toughest week of the toughest training program in the U.S. military, Dan Crenshaw would be reminded by his peers and instructors that he was already a Navy SEAL \xe2\x80\x94 all he had to do was prove it.
So to practice this, I might tell myself something like, \xe2\x80\x9cWill Michelle clean out her pantry today? Yes, she will. She\xe2\x80\x99s already an organized person.\xe2\x80\x9d Will this propel me to do it? It couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt. As Ryan Holiday writes, paraphrasing the Stoics, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are what we repeatedly do.\xe2\x80\x9d It may just be that we also are what we repeatedly say to ourselves in our heads.
