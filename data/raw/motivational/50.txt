The other day, I was chatting with a friend of a friend, a senior in high school who was getting ready to go off to college.
\xe2\x80\x9cI want to start my life over,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to reinvent myself, and prove that you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to follow the same path as everyone else.\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x9cYou can do that,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you have to be willing to do 1 thing that not very many teenagers and young adults are willing to do.\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.
This goes for anyone in school, out of school, young, old, whatever. You\xe2\x80\x99re either in class, or you\xe2\x80\x99re at work.
During those hours, you can learn. You can grow. You can improve certain skills. You can even make money.
But anyone who truly makes something of themselves sees that time as their daily standard. But they do not see it as \xe2\x80\x9cthe end.\xe2\x80\x9d They do not get out of class, or leave work and think, \xe2\x80\x9cAh, time to sit back, relax, and just chill.\xe2\x80\x9d
They work on a side project.
They practice their craft.
They improve their skills, or study, or spend time learning from people far more knowledgable.
They see it as the only time they have to do the things they really want to do in life \xe2\x80\x94 and they don\xe2\x80\x99t take a minute for granted.
Young people, especially, and the ones who achieve some sort of success at an early age, treat their free time this way. And anyone older, anyone in a job they don\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy and suddenly want to shift their life in a new direction, they begin treating their \xe2\x80\x9cfree time\xe2\x80\x9d accordingly.
People who make moves, and who make a difference, invest in themselves.
So, how do you do this?
I am a firm believer that in order to achieve anything in life, or really do something worthwhile, you have to have it be your Leading Goal. That is, you have to prioritize that 1 thing over everything else, to the point where you are able to practice it every single day.
How you measure \xe2\x80\x9csuccess\xe2\x80\x9d then is pretty simple: you either practiced for the day or you didn\xe2\x80\x99t.
If your Leading Goal is to get fit, you either went to the gym or you didn\xe2\x80\x99t.
If your Leading Goal is to write a book, you either wrote today or you didn\xe2\x80\x99t.
If your Leading Goal is to launch a startup, you either worked on that startup today or you didn\xe2\x80\x99t.
Investing in yourself, and really building yourself (or a project) begins with the daily habit of actually doing it.
We are all a reflection of who we spend time with.
Spend time with negative people, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll turn negative.
Spend time with positive people, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll turn positive.
It\xe2\x80\x99s just how the Law of Attraction works.
Similarly, if you spend time around people who share the same Leading Goal as you, or have a Leading Goal that inspires you to work harder toward your own Leading Goal, you will move and grow 10x faster.
This is why things like clubs, teams, and even accelerators and incubators are such a huge part of society. We know the value of community, and we try to create communities that help each of us improve at a faster rate.
When I was younger, I studied classical piano. It was a requirement in our family for each child to play a musical instrument, and my mother did a marvelous job at ensuring that we practiced each and every day.
On the days I really didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to practice, and would frantically play through songs I already knew how to play well, my mother would walk into the music room and take a seat in the nearby chair.
\xe2\x80\x9cCole,\xe2\x80\x9d she would say, in a stern voice.
\xe2\x80\x9cWhat.\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not practicing.\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x9cYes I am. Can\xe2\x80\x99t you hear me,\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99d say, banging on the keys some more.
\xe2\x80\x9cNo, you\xe2\x80\x99re playing. And that\xe2\x80\x99s fine. But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count toward your hour of practice. You need to practice something new,\xe2\x80\x9d she would say.
I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to. Practicing new things was hard. It meant fumbling through notes for hours and hours until finally they would stick to my fingers.
But, she was right. Just sitting there for an hour didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean I had practiced much of anything.
Just allocating the time to practice is only part of the battle. The other half comes down to what you do with that time, and how much you make it work for you.
