Sounds familiar, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?
Nowadays, almost every motivational speaker, success guru or \xe2\x80\x98mindset\xe2\x80\x99 coach blasts this message into the world and onto your YouTube, Instagram and Facebook feed.
We are constantly being fed this notion that hard work is the key to success. All we have to do is put in an insane amount of hours and energy into our goals and then success will magically appear on our doorstep.
But what if it isn\xe2\x80\x99t true?
What if this classic piece of advice doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work the way everyone thinks it does?
I mean, think about it for a second. Some of the hardest working people in our society such as construction workers, farmers, firefighters and military personnel are heavily underpaid.
If hard work would be the determining factor of financial or business success, these people would all be millionaires. But they aren\xe2\x80\x99t.
The belief that \xe2\x80\x98hard work = success\xe2\x80\x99 is simply not true. It\xe2\x80\x99s a false belief that can do more harm than good.
Okay, okay, I have to admit. Even though it may sound like it, I\xe2\x80\x99m not anti-hard work. You need to put in the time, effort and energy if you want to achieve ambitious goals. You can\xe2\x80\x99t cheat your way to success by playing FIFA on your Playstation all day.
However, and this is the whole point of why I\xe2\x80\x99m writing this article, there\xe2\x80\x99s something missing from the \xe2\x80\x98success equation\xe2\x80\x99. Something that not a lot of people talk about\xe2\x80\xa6
\xe2\x80\xa6 And that\xe2\x80\x99s why so many people, despite their hard work, fail to achieve their goals.
If you want to achieve anything worthwhile in a reasonable amount of time, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to start working smarter. Much, much smarter.
If you work 60 to 80-hour workweeks but you don\xe2\x80\x99t work strategically and neglect your priorities, it makes no sense. Yet, that\xe2\x80\x99s what most people do. That\xe2\x80\x99s because, nowadays, putting in a lot of hours and working hard is seen as a badge of honour that strokes the ego. However, in reality, most people (not all) who wear this badge of honour are simply wasting away their time by working on low to mid-value tasks.
In fact, most who work hard are merely keeping themselves busy. Very busy. And by using busyness as a shield, we protect ourselves from doing the things that we actually should do. We can hide behind hard work as an excuse to not have to look at the real reasons why we still haven\xe2\x80\x99t achieved what we thought we would have by now.
After all, we are working hard right? So that can\xe2\x80\x99t be the problem. Maybe we should put the blinders on and just work even harder. Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s the solution!
But the truth is\xe2\x80\xa6
Hard work does not equal success. Yes, it can be a component of success, but only when hard work is applied to the right tasks and activities. Only when you combine it with working smart.
It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter how hard you work if you work on the wrong things (aka, mid-low value tasks)
What we need to do instead is shift our thinking. We need to make the shift from quantity to quality. We need to focus on the value we produce instead of the effort we put in. That way we can actually make faster and more impactful progress than ever before.
If you want to short-cut the success process, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to start focusing on the value you create in your hours (the quality of those hours) instead of the number of hours your work (the quantity).
The number of hours that you work says absolutely zilch about the value you produce in a day. Yet, your success is directly linked to the value you create. And if you want to become more successful, you need to create more value.
This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you have to work more hours or put in more effort (although, you can). It means you should focus on those tasks and projects that create the most value for your company or your customers and eliminate those activities that don\xe2\x80\x99t create that much value.
The quality of your output is that what matters, no one really cares about the number of hours you worked or the amount of effort you put in.
One of the best ways to work smarter is by becoming extremely good at prioritizing your work. Through prioritizing, you can actually create 10x more value in 3\xe2\x80\x934 hours of work compared to what you\xe2\x80\x99d normally create in an entire day.
Keep in mind, not all tasks or to-do\xe2\x80\x99s are created equal. In fact, some of your tasks, projects or to-do\xe2\x80\x99s are 10x more valuable than others. Consistently crushing those tasks is what actually moves the needle significantly towards the achievement of your goals. While those other lower value tasks are merely time & energy consuming while not contributing that much towards the achievement of your goal.
Working hard becomes less necessary when you know what\xe2\x80\x99s truly important and what\xe2\x80\x99s not. When you learn what tasks and projects actually move the needle and which ones don\xe2\x80\x99t, that\xe2\x80\x99s when you\xe2\x80\x99re actually working smart. This saves you a lot of time and energy while in fact speeding up the process towards achieving your goals.
\xe2\x80\x9cThere is an art to clearing away the clutter and focusing on what matters most. It is simple and it is transferable. It just requires the courage to take a different approach.\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x94 George Anders
When you consistently tackle your most important tasks, there is no need for 60 to 80-hour workweeks. In fact, working that many hours is merely a sign that you\xe2\x80\x99re not good at prioritizing and that you need to become stricter about what tasks and activities you spend your valuable time and energy on.
One of the techniques that I personally use to prioritize is the 80/20 rule. In short, the 80/20 rule states that 20% of inputs are responsible for roughly 80% of outcomes. In other words, about 20% of your tasks and activities are actually responsible for 80% of your desired outcomes.
This means that just a few things truly matter.
Only a handful of tasks and activities are mission critical and significantly move the needle towards the achievement of your goals. Those handful of tasks are the ones that you should spend the majority of your time and effort on. All other tasks that do not belong in the top 20% should be given much less time, be outsourced or eliminated entirely.
That\xe2\x80\x99s how you can start to free up much more time, headspace and focus for those tasks and activities that truly matter. When you consistently work on your top 20% tasks, you are truly being effective. That\xe2\x80\x99s when your odds of success increase massively.
\xe2\x80\x9cThings which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter least .\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x94 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
Rather than crushing 25 to-do\xe2\x80\x99s in a day, aim to tackle only 3 to 6 tasks. Yet, make sure these tasks are incredibly valuable. By doing so, all the other low and mid-value tasks will either be (1) unnecessary or (2) much easier to accomplish.
When you find yourself being overworked and spread too thin, you need to narrow your focus on those few tasks and projects that actually matter the most. Therefore, I\xe2\x80\x99d encourage you to do an 80/20 analysis of your work as often as possible.
First, identify your most important desired outcomes (sales, new leads etc.) and then identify which 1\xe2\x80\x935 tasks contribute the most towards these desired outcomes. Those tasks should become your priorities and that\xe2\x80\x99s where you should spend your time and energy on.
Rather than following the \xe2\x80\x98hard work = success\xe2\x80\x99 train of thought, follow the \xe2\x80\x98hard work + smart work = success\xe2\x80\x99 train of thought. In fact, working smarter is even more important than working harder. You need to continuously think about how you\xe2\x80\x99re spending your time, how much value you\xe2\x80\x99re creating in the hours that you work \xe2\x80\x94 and whether you\xe2\x80\x99re focused on quality over quantity. If you do this consistently, your odds of success will increase a lot more compared to just blindly working hard.
