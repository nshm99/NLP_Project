For the longest time, I believed that if smart people worked hard and grew up in a reasonably nurturing environment, success would come eventually.
I looked at other people and thought, \xe2\x80\x9cWow, that person\xe2\x80\x99s going to go on to do great things.\xe2\x80\x9d
But as I grew older, I realized that\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily the case. A few people I know who are intelligent and have a strong work ethic have gone on to do notable things, while many others are doing fine. Unfortunately, there are some that drift along, unsure about what to do.
I then realized that there are a lot of factors when it comes to success, whether it means having a fulfilling career, having great relationships, or staying healthy. Yes, smarts are part of it, and so is work ethic. But there\xe2\x80\x99s more at play than just these two factors.
Here are seven reasons why you might not be finding success even if you\xe2\x80\x99re smart and hardworking:
It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to stick to people you\xe2\x80\x99ve known for a long time. You know each other\xe2\x80\x99s histories and can laugh at inside jokes together. The problem with old friends, though, is that the same ideas are recycled over and over again, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t get to learn new perspectives outside of your bubble.
It can be tough to reach out at first to new people, but starting small can help. Aim for a low goal initially, such as introducing yourself to one person a week.
\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to fight to reach your dream. You have to sacrifice and work hard for it.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Lionel Messi
Being in the same environment for a long time makes it hard to adapt to something new. The good news is that change presents a chance for opportunities and innovation.
Instead of resisting changes, see how you can make the best of them. Maybe you can cater to a growing businesses need or see a different perspective.
Be open to new concepts and curious about the world around you.
Smart people often choose the safe route. They might follow the same path as their peers or choose a career because it\xe2\x80\x99s considered acceptable by their peers.
While this guarantees a degree of security, it can be mundane. I hear so often from smart people that they find their jobs unfulfilling and that they want to do something else, but are afraid to do so.
If you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking about branching out into unfamiliar territory, consider what your life will be like decades from now if you opt not to pursue something. Will you regret it, or will you be happy with your decision?
People that worked hard in school are used to being at the top and told how much potential they show. This seems good initially, but there are some negative side effects.
I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard people claim they deserve something because of their intelligence or where they went to school. They expect things to pan out automatically because of their credentials. Sadly, though, life doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work like that.
In the real world, you don\xe2\x80\x99t get results based on the work you put in. You get results based on the combination of hard work, strategic thinking, and some luck involved. You can increase that last factor by working on the first two.
One thing I hear often from high achievers is that they hate wasting time.Smart people are all too aware of the value of their time, as time and effort spent on one thing means that they could potentially be missing out on something else.
While this is a strong attribute, it also means chasing the next big thing and not following through. Starting out in any field or endeavor is tough, and getting through the initial obstacles requires patience.
Focusing effort on one goal yields much better results in the long run than going after one thing, getting bored, and then going after something new.
Being smart and working hard can open up numerous doors. Unfortunately, having too many options can be as restricting as having few choices.
An abundance of choices makes it difficult to decide what to do. As a result, it\xe2\x80\x99s tempting to jump around and \xe2\x80\x9csee what suits you\xe2\x80\x9d. I knew someone who attended numerous graduate school programs, one after another. Over ten years later, she still can\xe2\x80\x99t figure out what to do.
Rather than dabbling in many endeavors, I suggest testing things out first. Talk to other people and do the research before making a big decision, so that you know whether or not an option suits your personality and lifestyle.
Surprisingly, smart people can underestimate their own abilities. They are their own worst critic, causing them to believe that they can\xe2\x80\x99t accomplish as much as they can.
Smart people have high standards when it comes to their work. Whenever they work on a project, they tend to scrutinize and second-guess the final product.
This seems like a good thing on the surface, but it\xe2\x80\x99s often more debilitating than helpful. Perfectionism can hinder people from progressing forward in their goals or starting on anything in the first place.
\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to believe in yourself because the idea of self is an artificial construction. You are, in fact, part of the glorious oneness of the universe. Everything beautiful in the world is within you.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Russell Brand
So instead of letting fears of \xe2\x80\x9cwhat if\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not good enough\xe2\x80\x9d keep you back from something new, think of how you want your life to look like years from now. Getting started beats waiting for something to happen anytime.
