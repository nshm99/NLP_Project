Personal development is an abstract topic, which means different things to different people. And there\xe2\x80\x99s no singular strategy for measuring it.
What does \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal development\xe2\x80\x9d mean? The word implies that there\xe2\x80\x99s a progression to it. So if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, in what stage are you now? I\xe2\x80\x99ll briefly answer those questions in this article. Equipped with that information, you can improve yourself more effectively.
When I talk about personal development, I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the activities that will make you a reliable human being. Someone you can count on.
To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s the modern version of philosophy. In Ancient Rome, philosophy was mostly a practical pursuit. There were actual schools where you could study the art of becoming a better person.
Along the way, we\xe2\x80\x99ve turned philosophy into an academic pursuit. It\xe2\x80\x99s turned into an analysis of who said what, and why.
The word philosophy comes from the Greek word \xcf\x86\xce\xb9\xce\xbb\xce\xbf\xcf\x83\xce\xbf\xcf\x86\xce\xaf\xce\xb1, philosophia, which means the love of wisdom. Historically, a philosopher was a practitioner of the knowledge they possessed.
Well-known ancient philosophers like Aristotle, Socrates, Seneca, Epictetus, Buddha, Confucius, were all practitioners of their knowledge \xe2\x80\x94 they practiced what they preached. This trend remained true until the 19th century.
Modern philosophers like William James and Sigmund Freud all practiced philosophy. They mostly had other jobs. James was a psychologist and later became a teacher. Freud was a neurologist.
But in the 20th century, philosophers became talkers of knowledge. Philosophy became an academic career \xe2\x80\x94 it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter whether you practiced your knowledge. Why is it important to know this history? We all have a thirst of wisdom, so we need to get it from somewhere.
So when philosophy started changing last century, other people filled the gap. Who were those people? It started with Napoleon Hill, Wallace D. Wattles, Earl Nightingale, Jim Rohn, and other figures who are now active in the personal development space.
Instead of going to ancient school of philosophy, we join online communities, read blogs, and learn from each other. The goal is to become a better, more reliable, human being.
I\xe2\x80\x99ve identified four stages of personal development. Awareness of these stages help us understand where we are in our journey towards becoming a better person. By understanding where you are, you can take the necessary steps in your personal development.
All growth comes from pain. Without a reason to pursue self-actualization, we never start. Every person goes through a period of darkness and challenge in their lives. This is where most of us discover the power of self-development.
I was always interested in productivity, business, and personal development. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t take it seriously until 2014/2015. I was going through personal challenges like dealing with loss, lack of career perspective, a break up, back pain, you name it. None of those challenges were huge by themselves, but the combination was tough. At some point, you start looking for answers.
Around the same time, my brother was also going through that phase. So we shared books and inspired each other to learn more.
Once you discover the world of personal development, you become hopeful. You realize, \xe2\x80\x9cHey, I can turn my life around. I can become better, stronger, more reliable.\xe2\x80\x9d So you go on a whole consumption spree.
You read books, blogs, listen to podcasts, watch documentaries \xe2\x80\x94 your thirst for knowledge is endless. When you\xe2\x80\x99re in this stage, keep on drinking from the well of knowledge, my friend.
I spent about 18 months consuming everything I could. I mean that literally. I was reading, listening, and watching inspiring things all day long. I read 2 to 3 books a week, journaled at least an hour a day, and listened to podcasts or watched interviews every hour.
But you can\xe2\x80\x99t do that forever. At some point, you want to live what you\xe2\x80\x99ve learned. So you start applying it to your personal life, health, career, business, etc. You start seeing changes. You embody the knowledge you\xe2\x80\x99ve acquired.
Once you\xe2\x80\x99ve learned and applied your knowledge successfully, you want to share it with others. This could be with your family, friends, co-workers, team, or strangers.
Not everyone who goes through the stages of self-development becomes a teacher by profession, but everyone I\xe2\x80\x99ve met who improved themselves, also wants to inspire others to do the same. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to tell others to improve.
Just by setting the right example, you\xe2\x80\x99re inspiring others how to do the same. To me, that\xe2\x80\x99s the real purpose of teaching.
Finally, these stages are not mutually exclusive. It depends on the area you\xe2\x80\x99re focusing on. One might be at stage three when it comes to personal productivity, but at stage one when it comes to developing self-reliance.
This sums up the four stages of self-development. If we\xe2\x80\x99re lucky, we can spend the majority of our lives in the final stage. But all stages are great places to be. It beats \xe2\x80\x9cstage 0\xe2\x80\x9d which is where the majority of the population live \xe2\x80\x94 in a state of unawareness. Anything beats that!
Especially learning. If that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t excite you, nothing can!
