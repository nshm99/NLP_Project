When Batman meets Superman for the first time in Dawn of Justice, you instantly know who\xe2\x80\x99s in charge and who\xe2\x80\x99s in trouble.
After crashing the Batmobile and interrupting Bruce Wayne on his rogue mission, Superman tells him to \xe2\x80\x98bury the bat\xe2\x80\x99 and let it go, putting mercy before justice. Of course Batman doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, swearing revenge.
Lately, I feel a lot like Superman in this scene. With a stern look on my face, I swoop in to try and fix other people\xe2\x80\x99s mess, but don\xe2\x80\x99t get much credit for it. This is a cause for concern, but not about those other people, about me.
A lot of us strive to become superhuman, but this pursuit has a shadow. It looms ever closer and if we don\xe2\x80\x99t watch out, it\xe2\x80\x99ll swallow us whole.
Despite our best intentions, self-improvement can make us worse.
Over the past three years, I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten really good at noticing things. Not just about myself, but others too. In fact, I now can\xe2\x80\x99t not notice things.
I notice when 10 out of 10 people on the subway are on their phone, when the dude in front of me is switching only between his sports betting account and Tinder and when the guy four seats over wastes all his time instead of working. I notice people who are always late, always behind and always broke and I can pinpoint exactly what needs fixing.
Now, I finally noticed that all this noticing is driving me nuts. I\xe2\x80\x99d love to say \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind\xe2\x80\x9d and mean it, but it\xe2\x80\x99s never true. I do mind. I mind everything.
Mindfulness is a gift when it\xe2\x80\x99s directed inward, but outward? Not so much. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing to realize you\xe2\x80\x99re biting your nails, but constantly observing other people\xe2\x80\x99s behavior? That\xe2\x80\x99s a curse.
Why?
Mark Twain remarked that \xe2\x80\x9ccomparison is the death of joy.\xe2\x80\x9d But, and this is worse, it\xe2\x80\x99s also the birth of misery.
Comparing ourselves is an instinct as fundamental as survival itself. If Gronk can outrun the bear, pick the right berries and get the pretty neanderthal lady, maybe you should be more like Gronk. In a modern society built mainly on and for individual freedom, however, this is useless.
And yet, every notice is a new chance to compare. He eats well, I should eat better. She wastes time, I\xe2\x80\x99m more productive. Even if we rationally estimate our own abilities, comparing still hurts us, an Oxford study suggests:
\xe2\x80\x9cThe findings potentially have implications for social interactions in the workplace as well as clinical disorders such as depression.\xe2\x80\x9d
Interesting, right? Confidence and clinical depression can have the same source: comparing yourself to others. Most of the time, the results of your comparisons don\xe2\x80\x99t even matter.
You\xe2\x80\x99ll land in a bad place anyway.
Most people make poor choices. They don\xe2\x80\x99t want to worry about money, or getting up early, or if what they do matters. They, however, would never consider these choices poor. That label is pure judgement on my part.
The problem is that with so much mindfulness, millions of mini comparisons, judgement itself becomes a habit. This is a common side effect of self-improvement. Since it\xe2\x80\x99s all about getting better, you\xe2\x80\x99re left with only two opinions of other people:
Whichever one you settle on, you lose. This is self-improvement\xe2\x80\x99s dark secret.
When you constantly compare yourself and decide you\xe2\x80\x99re worse, you spiral into depression. But what happens when you think you\xe2\x80\x99re better?
Imagine you\xe2\x80\x99re Superman. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to compare, you have actual proof: you can\xe2\x80\x99t die, you know everything and you\xe2\x80\x99re physically stronger than anyone. You\xe2\x80\x99re the ultimate success in self-improvement.
Unlike most of us, Superman didn\xe2\x80\x99t choose his superiority, but he paid the same price: loneliness.
Sebastian Marshall perfectly described it in an essay 6 years ago:
You know what I think it is? You won\xe2\x80\x99t be understood once you step off into the abyss. The more you do it, the more people won\xe2\x80\x99t understand.
The second guy I mentioned, the effort guy? He\xe2\x80\x99s got coworkers right now he can commiserate with who understand him. The business idea I mentioned to him doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist right now and there\xe2\x80\x99s a demand for it. His income is such that even with a low price point he could still make 2x-3x what he\xe2\x80\x99s making now and fulfill a market need.
But then what? Then he\xe2\x80\x99s the only guy doing this thing. No commiseration. People won\xe2\x80\x99t understand him as much. And the more you do that, the more people don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. If you keep taking all those edges that no one else will, pretty soon your neighbors don\xe2\x80\x99t understand you, can\xe2\x80\x99t understand you.
It\xe2\x80\x99s just you.
The higher you climb on the mountain, the thinner the air gets. More success, fewer fellow climbers, until you\xe2\x80\x99re left with only one truth:
You\xe2\x80\x99re the best, but you\xe2\x80\x99re alone.
Medium is full of posts telling people how they can become the best. Be more creative, more productive, more aware. But once you achieve that, once you\xe2\x80\x99re better, faster, stronger, how do you blend back in?
Even if you become superhuman, you\xe2\x80\x99ll still spend your life among mortals. How do you deal with that? I see no posts about this issue.
We\xe2\x80\x99re so worried about acquiring power \xe2\x80\x94 over our minds, our bodies, our time \xe2\x80\x94 that we forget learning how to use it responsibly to serve the world we live in.
And so, often, by the time we get it, we\xe2\x80\x99re victims of our own success.
It all happens slowly, of course. One day you opt out of binge drinking, the next you tell your friends to get their shit together and two years later, you run your own dev shop while they extended yet another semester.
You notice, you compare and through the years, you silently collect millions of judgements until you conclude you\xe2\x80\x99re alone. You might succeed in self-improvement, but fail in being human.
This is the dangerous path many of us are on. I know I am. I must find a way to turn off my comparison machine, because it\xe2\x80\x99s been running too long already. That\xe2\x80\x99s the big, wicked twist of the story.
In that scene from the beginning, I\xe2\x80\x99m not Superman. I\xe2\x80\x99m Batman.
A lot of us are. The frustration from the loneliness of our path makes us bitter, impatient, and angry. So we abandon our true mission, one comparison at a time, until we can retreat only into our lonely cave of judgment. Not despite, but because we come out on top.
You may feel you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to pay the toll of self-improvement, but you still might not like who you turn into. We think we\xe2\x80\x99re improving ourselves, when actually, we\xe2\x80\x99re becoming the villain of our own story.
If you run away from mediocrity, but right into malice, what good does it do?
For Clark Kent, the option to compare went out the window when he was a child. The moment he pushed the first school bus out of the river, any doubts were gone: if he goes rogue, we all die. Lucky for us all, before putting on his cape, Superman turned his powers inward.
That\xe2\x80\x99s what we must do and it\xe2\x80\x99s much more important than how much power we have. The problem is neither other people\xe2\x80\x99s indifference to, nor our obsession with self-improvement. It\xe2\x80\x99s the comparison that stinks.
Be better for the sake of being a better you, not better than everyone else.
There\xe2\x80\x99s not much to gain from Pomodoro timers and dollar cost averaging for the people who enjoy their lives precisely for the lack of those things. It just so happens that because I care about self-improvement, I care about you-improvement too. Because then we could nerd out together. But we can\xe2\x80\x99t and so I feel lonely.
It is my duty to deal with that loneliness and make sure it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t drag me down. There is no \xe2\x80\x98other people\xe2\x80\x99s mess\xe2\x80\x99. Just my mess. Nothing to swoop in for. The dirt is in front of my own doorstep, waiting for me to sweep.
You have a dirty doorstep too. Only if we all sweep will our streets be clean.
When the world asked him to, Superman turned himself in. When the world asked him to, Superman appeared in court. Knowing full well the rules did not apply, he abided by them anyway, for the sake of the greater good.
In a sick twist of fate, meeting the renegade bat led to his doomsday. As the ultimate of human evolution, Superman paid the ultimate price. It\xe2\x80\x99s what makes it so hard to get out of the trap: You can be a saint and still lose.
That\xe2\x80\x99s why the movie is beloved by hardcore fans, but commercially, far from the success it should have been. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see the hero do everything right and then die. We know life\xe2\x80\x99s not fair, but we hate to be reminded of this reality.
And so, as he tries to build a new team of heroes in a post-Superman world, Batman is too late when he realizes it was never his turn to judge:
Alfred: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got a team here!\xe2\x80\x9d
Bruce Wayne: \xe2\x80\x9cSuperman could bring this team together better than I ever could. His strength\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d
Alfred: \xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter how strong you are or what abilities youmight have\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d
Bruce Wayne: \xe2\x80\x9cHe was more human than I am.\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x94 Silence \xe2\x80\x94
Bruce Wayne: \xe2\x80\x9cHe lived in this world. Fell in love, got a job. Despite all that power. The world needs Superman.\xe2\x80\x9d
Finally, Batman learns a true hero is not defined by the superiority of his power, but by the times he chooses to wield it. This moment is called a Harajuku Moment. Coined by Chad Fowler, Tim Ferriss defined it in The 4-Hour Body:
\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an epiphany that turns a nice-to-have into a must-have. There is no point in getting started until it happens. No matter how many bullet points and recipes I provide, you will need a Harajuku Moment to fuel the change itself.\xe2\x80\x9d
We all need such a moment in our quest for self-improvement. You have to acknowledge you\xe2\x80\x99re not a hero to start acting like one. I had mine when I read this quote in The Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday:
\xe2\x80\x9cWhen philosophy is wielded with arrogance and stubbornly, it is the cause for the ruin of many. Let philosophy scrape off your own faults, rather than be a way to rail against the faults of others.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Seneca
Superman is dead. We must become our own heroes, or his sacrifice was in vain. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where you\xe2\x80\x99ll find your Harajuku Moment, but you need one. Until then, until we learn to use our powers, the best we can do is ask:
What would Superman do?
Most of the time, he would probably just keep sweeping.
