One of my greatest talents has always been coming up with an excuse for putting off something I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to do.
Skipped the gym? Eh, I\xe2\x80\x99ll just make up for it tomorrow.
Hit the snooze button? Well, I needed the rest.
Brushed off a task on my to-do list? It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that important.
Procrastination is always an inner battle. But losing it has greater consequences than a missed workout or a blown deadline every now and then.
Six years ago, I tried to pursue my dream of becoming an entrepreneur: I did some freelance writing, built websites, and took on some content marketing and design projects. But, despite all the time I put in, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t seeing the results I wanted. Why? Because I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get myself to do the uncomfortable work \xe2\x80\x94 the difficult, tedious, and unsatisfying tasks that come with actually building a business. I kept looking for relief from those tasks, often scrolling through the news or going out (yet again) for a coffee break.
That was, and to a degree still is, the story of my life. Right now, I\xe2\x80\x99m writing a book. Writing is hard. I keep fighting the urge to put off the work. But I\xe2\x80\x99m moving along and getting it done. The only difference between my life six years ago and my life today is that I now have a system.

Here\xe2\x80\x99s what I mean. To be truly productive, you can\xe2\x80\x99t rely on hacks or apps or new technologies. Trust me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried. You need to develop your own sustainable system, a set of routines and practices that serves as the foundation of your work. My system looks like this:
As you may have noticed, not all of these things are related to the work directly. That\xe2\x80\x99s okay. My system gets me in the right headspace to get the work done. It makes me a more disciplined person, so when I sit down to write, I can power through all my distracting thoughts and actually write.
You will always want to procrastinate. But if you have a system, you can be productive in spite of that. Work on creating one today \xe2\x80\x94 not tomorrow.
