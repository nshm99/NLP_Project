We\xe2\x80\x99re always waiting for inspiration to find us. We\xe2\x80\x99re waiting to get inspired to paint this perfect piece of art, to build the next big thing or to come up with this great advertising idea. We\xe2\x80\x99re just sitting there waiting.
I still do it sometimes, like an idiot as if I don\xe2\x80\x99t know better after all these years of chasing inspiration.
The problem with finding the perfect inspiration is that it\xe2\x80\x99s just a romantic dream. Waiting for inspiration to show up and solve my problems is really nothing more than an empty promise.
Inspiration is a little bit like love. Seeking for the perfect love is like seeking for perfect inspiration. The harder you try, the longer it will take. It\xe2\x80\x99s like magic, maybe even luck.
Now you might think that luck is not fair and rather unpredictable because some have more and some have less. For me luck is more like an attitude.
You might not be able to control your own luck or inspiration, but you can definitely enhance it\xe2\x80\x99s chances by putting yourself in positions where luck & inspiration is more likely to happen.
When talking about inspiration, we first need to stop seeking inspiration. This might sound counterproductive at first and appears to involve risk because we often work under pressure, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t have the time to stop thinking about something we actually need to think about.
Inspiration usually strikes when you are not forcing it to strike.
Let\xe2\x80\x99s just imagine inspiration exists as a random pattern in our life, as in the example I illustrated below. When forcing to find inspiration (see 1) my path is very linear/narrow and the chances are pretty low to get hit by inspiration \xe2\x80\x94 It will probably take forever.
If I don\xe2\x80\x99t try to force inspiration to happen, my path appears to be more organic & random (see 2). I might go for a walk, I go to the movies, read a book or just start working. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what I do, but what happens is that I put myself in situations where I\xe2\x80\x99m more likely to get hit by those little spots of inspiration.
The key is to start doing something, RIGHT NOW! \xe2\x80\x94 It\xe2\x80\x99s about to start working immediately even if you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel inspired or know where you are going yet. Inspiration will only hit you once you are already in motion, not while standing still doing nothing.
And as Pablo Picasso already said:
\xe2\x80\x9cInspiration exists,but it has to find us working.\xe2\x80\x9d
This is an interesting concept because it completely goes against our logic that we first have to be inspired in order to work. But in reality that\xe2\x80\x99s a lie \xe2\x80\x94 It\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the other way around.
So the next time you say \xe2\x80\x9cI just don\xe2\x80\x99t feel inspired right now\xe2\x80\x9d you know how to fix it. Start working right now and create your own inspiration.
Happy SundayTobias
