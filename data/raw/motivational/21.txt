I\xe2\x80\x99ve never really gotten much out of the inspirational quotes you can find all over Pinterest or Instagram. To me, these quotes are like candy \xe2\x80\x94 they might give you a quick boost, but they\xe2\x80\x99re mostly empty calories. Reminders to live, laugh, and love won\xe2\x80\x99t do much to actually change your life.
Still, I do have a practice of collecting words from those I admire and turning to them in challenging times. These days, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing that more often than usual. All of these quotes give me perspective and remind me of what\xe2\x80\x99s important. I hope some of them resonate with you, too.
That last line is one of my favorite inspirational quotes of all time. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t an ideal time for any of us, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the time we\xe2\x80\x99re in. No matter where you are in life or what happens, make the best of it.
