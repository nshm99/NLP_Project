\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t break the chain.\xe2\x80\x9d
These four simple words helped Jerry Seinfeld become one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most successful comedians.
Seinfeld\xe2\x80\x99s mantra pushed him to write new jokes every single day.
Using a wall calendar, he drew an \xe2\x80\x9cX\xe2\x80\x9d through each day on which he wrote. Once the Xs started forming a chain, his motivation grew.
\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain,\xe2\x80\x9d Seinfeld told a young comedian, who had asked for success tips.
Seinfeld\xe2\x80\x99s technique, which ultimately led to him landing a hit television show, is a perfect example of how success doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always begin with extraordinary motivation.
Like a snowball gathering speed, sometimes the motivation builds after you get started.
By nature, I\xe2\x80\x99m not a highly motivated person. I\xe2\x80\x99m not an early riser, I don\xe2\x80\x99t particularly love the gym and I don\xe2\x80\x99t read two new books each week.
But somehow I still managed to launch JotForm, and slowly grow a network of over 4.2 million users over the last twelve years. And I squeeze in a workout many mornings, too.
Getting stuff done doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always depend on motivation. We can accomplish great things, even when we just don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like it.
The more we avoid something, the higher our anxiety, and so we put it off further.
To stop the procrastination cycle, we need to first identify the reason why we\xe2\x80\x99re avoiding a task. Usually, it\xe2\x80\x99s about prevention or promotion.
Emotions play a key role both in promotion and prevention focus.
It\xe2\x80\x99s the \xe2\x80\x9cfeeling like\xe2\x80\x9d part that is the trickiest, but as Melissa Dahl shared in a 2016 article for The Cut:
\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t have to feel like getting something done in order to actually get it done.\xe2\x80\x9c
This is such a critical point. It\xe2\x80\x99s so simple, but often so difficult to apply.
Similarly, if you think something is boring or unpleasant, you need to take your feelings out of the equation and decide in advance exactly when and where you\xe2\x80\x99ll do it.
Say, every day at 7:00 am, you\xe2\x80\x99re at the gym. No emotions. There\xe2\x80\x99s no lying in bed, staring at the ceiling and weighing the pros and cons of exercise. Save yourself the decision fatigue and commit to your previously-determined schedule.
\xe2\x80\x9cWhere I\xe2\x80\x99d had huge success, I had narrowed my concentration to one thing, and where my success varied, my focus had, too \xe2\x80\xa6 Success is sequential, not simultaneous.\xe2\x80\x9d

Like my morning pages routine, motivation can be the result of an action, not the cause of it. Once we manage to get started, even in the smallest of ways, momentum will keep us going.
Sustained momentum toward a singular goal creates a compound effect. Which is, in essence, the concept that consistent, incremental changes can result in fundamental changes over time.
Between the ages of 32 and 44, Warren Buffett grew his net worth by 1,257 percent. But it\xe2\x80\x99s the next 12 years that are truly astounding.
From 44 to 56, he grew his net worth by 7,268 percent.
Slowly but surely, he started building up a chain of investments and never stopped.
The power of momentum can be explained with the idea called the Physics of Productivity, which is Newton\xe2\x80\x99s First Law applied to habit formation:
Objects in motion tend to stay in motion. Once a task has begun, it\xe2\x80\x99s easier to continue moving it forward.
If we start with a small action \xe2\x80\x94 putting on our running sneakers or finishing the presentation introduction \xe2\x80\x94 chances are we\xe2\x80\x99ll find it easier to continue.
This is where routines come in handy \xe2\x80\x94 to eliminate the decision-making process and decide not only when you\xe2\x80\x99ll do something, but also the exact steps.
Say you want to publish a new blog post but can\xe2\x80\x99t muster the motivation to get started. Commit to completing just one paragraph each day until it\xe2\x80\x99s done.
And to take it one step further: create a ritual to go with the activity. Pour a fresh cup of coffee, practice a couple minutes of mindful breathing and then get started.
Some of the most successful people believe in rituals. Take world-famous author and motivational speaker Tony Robbins.
Every morning, Robbins \xe2\x80\x9cprimes\xe2\x80\x9d his mind before he starts his day. In just 10 minutes, he performs three sets of 30 Kapalbhati Pranayama breaths, expresses gratitude and prays for help, guidance, and strength throughout the day. Then, brain primed, he starts his day.
Whatever you choose, your ritual will reduce the chance that you\xe2\x80\x99ll skip the activity. In fact, sometimes the ritual helps us look forward to it \xe2\x80\x94 like slipping on a pair of comfortable slippers the moment we get home.
Motivation isn\xe2\x80\x99t the fire that starts your engine.
Jeff Haden, author of The Motivation Myth, writes that it\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\xa6
\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6 the fire that starts burning after you manually, painfully, coax it into existence, and it feeds on the satisfaction of seeing yourself make progress.\xe2\x80\x9d
Many times, motivation comes after we start working toward a goal. The trick lies in getting ourselves to take that first step.
If we beat ourselves up for not having the motivation to start a task, then we\xe2\x80\x99re not making any headway.
But by figuring out what\xe2\x80\x99s stopping us, and then creating schedules and rituals, progress will come whether or not we feel like it. And in turn, the fire grows.
So decide what you want to accomplish, commit to a routine and remember Seinfeld\xe2\x80\x99s advice: don\xe2\x80\x99t break the chain.
