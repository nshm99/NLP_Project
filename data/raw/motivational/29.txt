It started to dawn on me that I was actually really tired of trying to be better, that all the things I was doing weren\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily making me stronger. There was a lot of dependency on external input, what I call the paraphernalia of the new age. And it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hard to see this. But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just me that was feeling that way. It was really me and all my girlfriends. Every time I get off stage the women would come up to me and I\xe2\x80\x99d hear the same things. Basically, we\xe2\x80\x99re really tired. And this is not the point, further fatigue, berating yourself. I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure that this is not the point of walking the spiritual path. \xe2\x80\x94 Danielle LaPorte on The Unmistakable Creative.
Given that I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent the last decade broadcasting other people\xe2\x80\x99s wisdom, reading self help books and writing some of them myself, this probably seems like an odd thing for me to say. But for many of us, the fundamental premise of our personal development efforts is that we are in some way deficient or broken. Few things contribute to our misery like a sense of deficiency.
Throughout my life I\xe2\x80\x99ve felt deficient in some way or another:
Because of this sense of deficiency, I joined a cult that later became known as the seduction community, wrestled on and off with depression, and read 100\xe2\x80\x99s of self help books. I could probably open a therapy practice in my living room with the books on my shelf. I\xe2\x80\x99ve chased women who weren\xe2\x80\x99t into me when I should have just walked away and met someone who was actually excited about having me in their life.
When the fundamental premise of your personal development efforts is that you are broken in some way and need to be fixed, you end up perpetuating that reality.
\xe2\x80\x9cAs you label an object or situation\xe2\x80\x9d so it appears say the authors of the Three Laws of Performance. How do you label your current situation? Is it a problem you have to fix or is it an opportunity for growth? Our words are the building blocks of reality.
When we feel deficient in some way, our focus is on what we lack. Our default narrative is one of not enough. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough, we aren\xe2\x80\x99t good enough, etc, etc. This narrative blinds us to all we should be grateful for. It blinds us to our gifts and causes us to see the world through the lens of our weaknesses.
One of the strange paradoxes of personal development is that in order to make change, we have to begin by accepting the way things are, even if they are not ideal or to our liking. You can attempt to make change from a place of resistance or a place of acceptance.
When you attempt to make change from a place of resistance, everything is an uphill battle. You feel desperate and hopeless. But when you make change from a place of acceptance, experiences and circumstances flow through your life. You don\xe2\x80\x99t hang onto anything.
Your realize the only thing worth giving your energy to is what you can control.
My friend Kamal Ravikant has famously said to love yourself like your life depends on it. Sometime last I year I started to see an energy healer. After years of skepticism about inspiration and new age bullshit, I drank the Encinitas Kool aid. Our sessions centered around one thing: my impression of myself. Truth be told, I was struggling with my impression of myself. Occasionally, I still do. I sometimes hate my brain for the fact I\xe2\x80\x99ve dealt with depression and forget that it\xe2\x80\x99s the same brain that allowed me to write books and interview 700 people.
A few months ago, I was having a conversation with Amber Rae about her amazing book Choose Wonder over Worry. She was having lunch with Seth Godin and when he asked her about book marketing she laughingly said \xe2\x80\x9cI want to sell a million copies.\xe2\x80\x9d But what struck me most is what Seth said to her. He said \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve already won. You got the book deal, you wrote the book, and have an amazing fiance.\xe2\x80\x9d
In the midst of my own book launch, this is something I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to keep in mind. The desire to sell as many copies as possible can cause you to overlook an opportunity to practice gratitude:
When you\xe2\x80\x99re caught up in the round of funding you haven\xe2\x80\x99t raised, the startup that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t grown as fast as you\xe2\x80\x99d like or the bestseller list you didn\xe2\x80\x99t hit, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to delude yourself into thinking you\xe2\x80\x99ve lost, and overlook all the ways in which you\xe2\x80\x99ve won.
The constant effort to improve ourselves in a world driven by self help books, podcasts, life hacks, list posts, life coaches, thought leaders, and unicorn startup founders can be exhausting.
When the standard by which we measure our lives is a never ending parade of accomplishments and accolades, it becomes all too easy to prioritize what author and New York Times columnist David Brooks calls resumes values over eulogy values.
In our desperate striving for excellence, we paradoxically reduce its likelihood. Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s time we shifted the fundamental premise of personal development from you\xe2\x80\x99re broken and need to be fixed to you\xe2\x80\x99re good and aspiring to be great.
