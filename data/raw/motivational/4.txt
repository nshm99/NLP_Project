When most people think of accountability partners, they cringe.
It feels like a lot of work. It feels hard, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not. It\xe2\x80\x99s essential to making extreme progress in your life.
It\xe2\x80\x99s also very easy. Something you can do in less than 2 minutes per day.
In this short article, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to explain what makes a great accountability partnership.
I\xe2\x80\x99m then going to break down a very simple way you can do daily accountability with your partner in a way that is motivating but not overwhelming.
Stoked?
Let\xe2\x80\x99s start.
The #1 mistake people make that stops them from starting an accountability partnership is thinking that they need to find someone with similar interests or goals as them.
That is totally bogus.
It\xe2\x80\x99s actually better to have someone who isn\xe2\x80\x99t doing the same things you are. The purpose of accountability isn\xe2\x80\x99t shared interest, but shared accountability.
It seriously doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what your accountability partner is trying to accomplish. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if you\xe2\x80\x99ve never met them in person.
The only thing that matters is finding someone who will hold you accountable.
Find someone with the same level of ambition and desired accountability as you.
That\xe2\x80\x99s it.
Once you find someone who wants the same level of accountability as you, then you need a simple and fast system.
Daily accountability is the best way to form a habit and rhythm with your partner.
If you try to do weekly, you\xe2\x80\x99ll likely lose track or forget.
You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose momentum.
Aside from getting obsessed with finding the right partner, the second biggest mistake is losing momentum before you even start.
Daily accountability is essential.
It\xe2\x80\x99s how you get into a rhythm and stay on track. That\xe2\x80\x99s the purpose of accountability. It\xe2\x80\x99s not about friendship. It\xe2\x80\x99s not about kinship. It\xe2\x80\x99s not about fun. Accountability is about getting results in your life.
Do you want results? Or are you just looking for a friend?
Accountability partners will become some of your best friends, but only because you are pushing each other forward.
The purpose of the relationship isn\xe2\x80\x99t to be friends.
It\xe2\x80\x99s actually almost better if you choose someone who isn\xe2\x80\x99t already your friend. The sole purpose of the relationship should be accountability.
That\xe2\x80\x99s it.
In the book, Atomic Habits, James Clear wisely shares a principle he calls \xe2\x80\x9cthe art of showing up.\xe2\x80\x9d
He tells the story of a man who wanted to establish a habit of going to the gym every day. So he spent the first six weeks limiting himself to only five minutes in the gym.
He\xe2\x80\x99d go to the gym every day for five minutes, and then force himself to leave!
Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he just stay if he was already there?
Because he wanted to establish the habit of just showing up.
As Clear states, \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot optimize what you don\xe2\x80\x99t have.\xe2\x80\x9d
People focus too much on the end-game, rather than starting. Most of the friction to success is getting yourself going.
So, rather than being overly ambitious \xe2\x80\x94 your accountability partnership needs to be extremely low friction and easy.
It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take more than two minutes per day.
Here\xe2\x80\x99s how it works.
Every morning, shoot your accountability partner a text (or email if that\xe2\x80\x99s preferred), stating your three goals for the day.
At the end of the day, you report how you did. In addition to reporting on your \xe2\x80\x9cbig 3\xe2\x80\x9d, you should also list the three things you\xe2\x80\x99ll do the next day.
Then the next morning, you re-list the same things you did the night before.
The reason you want to report your results for the day and list the three things you\xe2\x80\x99ll do the next day is that it removes decision-making the next morning.
These two texts messages should take you less than two minutes to type out per day.
Here\xe2\x80\x99s what mine looks like with my accountability partner. As you\xe2\x80\x99ll see, my partner\xe2\x80\x99s contact is even named in my phone \xe2\x80\x9cDAILY ACCOUNTABILITY\xe2\x80\x9d:
Once you master the art of showing up with these daily texts, you may add in a weekly element.
Every week, on Sunday nights, in addition to reporting on our \xe2\x80\x9cDaily 3,\xe2\x80\x9d we also list our \xe2\x80\x9cBig 3\xe2\x80\x9d for the following week.
Here\xe2\x80\x99s what it looks like:
In addition to daily and weekly, you may share your monthly goals with each other. This is optional.
Again, don\xe2\x80\x99t go overboard before you get started.
It \xe2\x80\x98s powerful to share your monthly goals with each other, but don\xe2\x80\x99t bring these into your daily accountability.
The purpose of this type of accountability is consistency and lack of friction.
However, sharing big picture goals with each other can be powerful.
Remember: the accountability partnership is intended to serve you, not you serve it.
Here\xe2\x80\x99s a quick snapshot of a monthly goal set:
Every day, my accountability partner and I send two texts to each other.
At the beginning of the day, we simply list our three objectives for the day.
At the end of the day, we report how we did (e.g., 2/3) and then list our three objectives for the next day. We do this to eliminate decision fatigue and set ourselves up for a powerful morning routine.
Once per week, we share our three objectives for the week, and at the end of the week, we report how we did on those objectives (e.g., 3/3).
Every month, we share our monthly objectives. We also do a 30\xe2\x80\x9360-minute phone call to discuss how our month went.
That\xe2\x80\x99s it.
In the past month, I\xe2\x80\x99ve overcome bad habits and emotional blocks that held me back for a really long time.
The core purpose of accountability and reporting your progress is awareness. You can\xe2\x80\x99t improve what you\xe2\x80\x99re not actively aware of.
This is the reason most people never become excellent at things. They don\xe2\x80\x99t track and report their progress, daily.
If you want to become successful in any area of your life, you need to measure and report how you\xe2\x80\x99re doing daily.
This will force you to focus on it.
What you focus on expands.
Your greatest asset is your conscious awareness.
When you become conscious of something and then aggressively seek improvement in that thing with tangible goals and reporting of progress, your momentum will skyrocket.
