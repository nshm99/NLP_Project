Best line #1: Goals are for losers.
Best line #2: My optimism is like an old cat that likes to disappear for days, but I always expect it to return.
Here is one of the most important lines I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever read in nonfiction: goals are for losers. It\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful four-word sentence that immediately switched my thinking while also affirming everything my experience had been telling me. Goals are for losers. What could that possibly mean?
For one thing, goals lead to a strange sense of letdown once they\xe2\x80\x99re achieved. Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s post talked about \xe2\x80\x9cpost achievement depression.\xe2\x80\x9d The best description of this effect is found in Scott Adams\xe2\x80\x99 book:
If you achieve your goal, you celebrate and feel terrific, but only until you realize you just lost the thing that gave you purpose and direction.
Goals are like matches. They can start a fire. And that\xe2\x80\x99s great but the fire burns out eventually and you have to find another match. It\xe2\x80\x99s akin to the standard motivational cycle. You hype yourself up to do something, get it done, and then have to hype yourself up again. And what about those times that you don\xe2\x80\x99t achieve your goals? I\xe2\x80\x99ve had this happen to me quite often, practically every day, and it always led to anger and frustration before reading this book.
There must be some other way.
Adams argues for a systems approach.
For our purposes, let\xe2\x80\x99s say a goal is a specific objective that you either achieve or don\xe2\x80\x99t sometime in the future. A system is something you do on a regular basis that increases your odds of happiness in the long run. If you do something every day, it\xe2\x80\x99s a system. If you\xe2\x80\x99re waiting to achieve it someday in the future, it\xe2\x80\x99s a goal.
When I first read this, I had already become a creature of strange habit. I had a system of sorts. And I had already stumbled on the idea of emergence so I understood that my habits were what drove a lot of my ability. But the habits were a little clunky and I was still enamored with the chase (I must achieve this thing) rather than the daily practice and the idea of multiple pursuits.
So Adams\xe2\x80\x99 idea seemed like a great connection between the findings of Cal Newport\xe2\x80\x99s book \xe2\x80\x9cDeep Work\xe2\x80\x9d and Ericsson\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPeak\xe2\x80\x9d. This was especially true with the view towards energy.
Energy
Adams argues that energy is the most vital resource for anyone\xe2\x80\x99s success. I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve all experienced this. When your energy is high, every possibility opens up. The trick is to understand that this energy isn\xe2\x80\x99t the result of your emotions; it\xe2\x80\x99s the other way around. And energy, like all such resources, can be cultivated.
Here\xe2\x80\x99s where we get to the boring, obvious stuff; the stuff you already know and maybe want to ignore. Adams writes below:
The most important form of selfishness involves spending time on your fitness, eating right, pursuing your career, and still spending quality time with your family and friends.
When I read this the first time, I felt a little guilt and some mild irritation. I paid fifteen bucks to read this? But the next line hit me pretty hard.
I\xe2\x80\x99m giving you permission to take care of yourself first, so you can do a better job of being generous in the long run.
The argument here is that the lack of self-care will only create a lack of energy and thus a real problem for your mental and physical state. Seems obvious but it\xe2\x80\x99s the phrase at the beginning that gets me: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m giving you permission \xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s powerful because we career-minded ambitious types never do this for ourselves; I think we actually wait for someone to tell us to do this and Adams knows it. Furthermore, he knows that self-care helps us care for others in the long run. Hence the word \xe2\x80\x9cgenerous\xe2\x80\x9d in his quote.
Some people would say this is where one needs a hobby. Trouble is, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really have hobbies. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I understand hobbies. Hence the lack of self-care.
What Adams basically argues is that hobby or not, there are things you can do that will create and sustain the right amount of energy which then leads to better states of mind and body. So you aren\xe2\x80\x99t a weekend fisherman? Don\xe2\x80\x99t belong to a quilting circle? Big deal. The real advice stands regardless: exercise, eat right, pursue career, spend time with friends and family.
These things need to be done every day. These are the foundations of the system. By doing them every day, you eliminate the strain of choice. These things steadily become force of habit. And as Jerry Seinfeld would say, doing them every day helps you make sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t break the chain.
The idea of doing these things every day fixed a real problem. Prior to this point, I had suffered serious inconsistency issues with fitness. I would tell myself, \xe2\x80\x9cWork out three days a week. Start with that modest goal. Then go to four days.\xe2\x80\x9d
Sounds good but that day in-between is a killer. You take one day off and then, somehow, you take two days off. Then three.
Now you\xe2\x80\x99re straying from the goal and feeling frustrated. Frustration saps energy. Not working out drains energy. Next thing you know, you\xe2\x80\x99re so tired you don\xe2\x80\x99t work out at all.
A lot of research has demonstrated that exercise actually creates energy. So what\xe2\x80\x99s the takeaway?
Do it every day. If you planned on working out three times a week, thirty minutes each time, it is far better to stretch those 90 minutes over seven days a week. Better to work out 13 minutes every day than 30 minutes 3 days a week. This is the systems approach.
Consider this, too: there is no goal here. Most times, people work out because they want to lose weight or run a 5k. And again, forgive the repetition, but what happens once the 5k is complete? The weight is lost? We sense what is known as the regression to the mean. Whatever happens to be your average day, your \xe2\x80\x9cmean\xe2\x80\x9d set of routines, is what you return to. The 5k was just a short-lived intervention; a brief affair.
By the way, this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really have anything to do with fitness. Exercise is simply a metaphor. Apply this to the workplace and the logic stands. For example, we often want to be responsive with customer service. But we don\xe2\x80\x99t just go in spurts of super-responsiveness (e.g., I\xe2\x80\x99ll answer every call on the first ring this week). Instead, we make a standard, such as responding to all voicemails within 24 hours, and we hold to it every day.
So the system is Adams\xe2\x80\x99 way of saying we must elevate our average day with a mindful, regular practice. We must make it better than the stuff of the Beatles lyric:
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Made my way upstairs and had a smoke
And everybody spoke and I went into a dream
Compare this with Adams\xe2\x80\x99 description of his mornings when working a full-time job:
Most people aren\xe2\x80\x99t lucky enough to have a flexible schedule. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have one either for the first sixteen years of my corporate life. So I did the next best thing by going to bed early and getting up at 4:00 A.M. to do my creative side projects. One of those projects became the sketches for Dilbert.
A fellow member of the 4:00 A.M. club. No wonder I love this book.
Simplicity vs Optimization
So systems. Right. Got it. But I ran into trouble with this idea right away. At work and at home. In both places, I started implementing routines and structures in the best fashion of LEAN practice, developing KPIs and feedback loops like some finely-tuned machine. I had a whole framework going and I had never been more miserable! It was terrible!
Terrible because Adams touches on something I knew but wanted to ignore: complexity makes things more difficult. It gets to a great dichotomy that he sets up later in the book, the difference between simplifiers and optimizers.
Some people are what I call simplifiers and some are optimizers. A simplifier will prefer the easy way to accomplish a task, while knowing that some amount of extra effort might have produced a better outcome. An optimizer looks for the very best solution even if the extra complexity increases the odds of unexpected problems.
To my great shame and humiliation, I am a consummate optimizer despite the fact I want to be a simplifier. But when you mix this knowledge with what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Gary Klein\xe2\x80\x99s book, Sources of Power, it starts to make sense. We are optimizers in every realm where we lack expertise. We build elaborate plans and systems in these places. An eager beginner to weight-lifting comes with an exercise log, pre-made sequence of lifts, quarterly benchmarks, and a post-workout protein shake. A long-time lifter just shows up at the gym.
So to split a hair in Adams\xe2\x80\x99 framework, the reality is that we all have a bit of simplifier and a bit of optimizer within us. Since I was new to building a daily system, my first few iterations (from two years ago) were much too elaborate. Here\xe2\x80\x99s an example below:
Exhausting, right? Over time, I redefined a number of these, combined a few, and eliminated #6 and #7 altogether. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t needed once my tastes changed. (There\xe2\x80\x99s a great amount of content in this book about how to mentally realign your food cravings and the techniques certainly worked for me.)
Today, the system is much more simple, lightweight, and strategic. True to the Pareto Principle, my daily practice underscores an 80/20 balance of what matters most. Roughly 20% of my day is committed to fulfilling the daily habits that, in turn, dictate the quality of the remaining 80% of the day.
I really dislike making this about me but it\xe2\x80\x99s the best way to explain the concept.
That said, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing this in the workplace for a while now. I\xe2\x80\x99m still tinkering with the approach but it\xe2\x80\x99s true to the tenets we find in the book review for Essentialism. Future posts and book reviews will show how this is carried out. For those who are familiar, a lot of it translates to practices found in Agile and Scrum techniques.
Compounding Interests
Monday\xe2\x80\x99s post was about the ratchet, the self-propelling virtuous/vicious cycles that take on a momentum of their own. The systems approach is all about creating ratchets with skill development. As Adams explains below:
A great strategy for success in life is to become good at something, anything, and let that feeling propel you to new and better victories. Success can be habit-forming.
Not only can it be habit-forming, it can also be opportunity-forming. Another great line from the book: Where there is a tolerance for risk, there is often talent.
Talent leads to initial skill development. This creates the initial ratchet and, over time, it creates a higher comfort level with risk. Or better yet, I think it leads to a deeper understanding of risk.
But that\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that you aren\xe2\x80\x99t talented unless you step out and do something stupid. The risk, I think, is more of the dance with failure that occupies the Tuesday and Thursday posts about right-sizing our \xe2\x80\x9cshot attempts\xe2\x80\x9d and achieving \xe2\x80\x9cnet positive failure\xe2\x80\x9d. Failure, if you remember, can be managed. Risk can be managed, too.
But what really helps solidify the connection between talent and risk is to see \xe2\x80\x9ctalent\xe2\x80\x9d as the basis for skill development. New skills create better risk profiles. Adams writes it this way: \xe2\x80\x9cEvery skill you acquire doubles your odds of success.\xe2\x80\x9d
This is absolutely true. To put a finer point on it, Adams offers this: Good + Good > Excellent.
In my case, I have some skill in graphic design. I have skill in writing. I have skill in data analysis. I have skill in presentation. None of these skills are \xe2\x80\x9cexcellent\xe2\x80\x9d but, in combination, they create something unique and anything unique is inherently more valuable.
But this isn\xe2\x80\x99t about me. You have a combination of good skills, too. The more you mix those skills together (and acquire new skills on top of them), the more you can do something that others can\xe2\x80\x99t. It\xe2\x80\x99s not that you and I are \xe2\x80\x9cjacks of all trades, masters of none\xe2\x80\x9d. That\xe2\x80\x99s a dumb construct. The truth is that we can be \xe2\x80\x9cjacks of all trades\xe2\x80\x9d and thus be a master of delivering something useful from that mix. Mastery isn\xe2\x80\x99t solely defined by the pre-constructed subjects you encounter in school. It can be defined in far more eloquent, reliable ways. But we\xe2\x80\x99ll save that for another book review when we get to Robert Greene.
Conclusion: Seek Emergent Success
I\xe2\x80\x99ll close with two final quotes from the book and encourage you to please grab a copy. There is far more to learn than what I can share here. The first quote is an offshoot of the old line from Seneca about how \xe2\x80\x9cLuck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d
From Adams, it reads like this: Success isn\xe2\x80\x99t magic; it\xe2\x80\x99s generally the product of picking a good system and following it until luck finds you.
Second is a line that goes to the concept introduced in Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s post about directional correctness:
Happiness has more to do with where you\xe2\x80\x99re heading than where you are.
Whatever the context, work or personal, home or office, if you define and rely on a proper system that maintains a high level of energy, that energy will help you generate more skill, more knowledge, more ability. These skills, knowledge, and abilities will help you see risk differently. This will give you more opportunities. Altogether, those new opportunities will be pursuits built on top of a foundation (i.e., system) that always ensures you are moving in the right direction.
Heading in the right direction creates a feeling of rightness and progress and this, in turn, ensures net positive traction. It\xe2\x80\x99s the ratchet.
And while it might seem like an act of faith, the reality is that tending to such things will undoubtedly lead to some sort of success. So ignore the goal-oriented stuff. Avoid the post achievement depression. A single track for a single goal is not resilient. Building a system, an infrastructure, that can support multiple goals, multiple initiatives, at the same time, is far better.
Designing your system isn\xe2\x80\x99t easy. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing it for two years now. There have been multiple drafts, believe me. But once it starts moving, you can\xe2\x80\x99t stop it. And they can\xe2\x80\x99t stop you.
So much more to learn. Buy the book on Amazon.
