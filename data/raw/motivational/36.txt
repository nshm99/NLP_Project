Startup advice can be seductive. From motivational quotes to magazine profiles, there\xe2\x80\x99s a persistent narrative that if you follow your passion, log 80 hours a week, and \xe2\x80\x9chustle hard,\xe2\x80\x9d you\xe2\x80\x99ll create the next Amazon or Airbnb.
It is possible.
We all know that hard work can produce incredible results. But the prevailing rise-and-grind mythology often pushes founders into business before they\xe2\x80\x99re ready.
Many smart, ambitious people feel pressured to quit their jobs and go all-in. They work around the clock, sacrificing their health and happiness to chase a startup dream.
For every founder who\xe2\x80\x99s battling exhaustion and surviving on protein bars, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to suggest a different path.
It\xe2\x80\x99s the same path that enabled me to build JotForm in a wildly competitive industry, where even Google is vying for our market share. Since 2006, we\xe2\x80\x99ve grown to serve 4.2 million users and create a team of 130 employees \xe2\x80\x94 and we\xe2\x80\x99ve done it without taking a penny in outside funding.
JotForm isn\xe2\x80\x99t an overnight success story, and I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t have a private jet. But, I\xe2\x80\x99ve built a business I love, while maintaining my freedom and a rich personal life.
Bootstrapping can be a great path for entrepreneurs of every kind. Here\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned \xe2\x80\x94 and how it can help you to achieve success on your own terms.
Many founders think venture capital is a prerequisite for success. Reports of record-breaking funding rounds and billion-dollar valuations can certainly make it seem that way.
But investment isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only way to fund a business.
A growing number of founders, or \xe2\x80\x9cbootstrappers\xe2\x80\x9d are building their companies with little or no outside funding. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have to fuss over investment decks and most could care less about reaching the top of TechCrunch . Very few worry about creating personal brands on Instagram \xe2\x80\x94 especially in the early stages. They\xe2\x80\x99re more concerned about serving real customers, who support their ideas with hard-earned cash.
They might not be as visible as entrepreneurs who spend a fortune on PR agencies, but in every industry, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find independent, self-funded companies that are also wildly profitable. For example:
MailChimp co-founder and CEO Ben Chestnut needed to create email newsletters for his design consulting clients. He built a tool to streamline this tedious process, and created a business worth $4.2 billion , with $600 million in annual revenues.
Todoist is a market leader in productivity, used by over 10 million people and organizations including Apple, Starbucks, Google. Amir Salihefendic launched its parent company, Doist, in 2007 and says \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re running a marathon, not a sprint.\xe2\x80\x9d
Basecamp started in 2004, when Jason Fried and his web design firm needed a project management app to keep them organized. They built an internal tool, started using it with clients, and now have nearly 2.2 million customers and employees in 30 cities worldwide.
These are just a few businesses that are racking up customers and profits to rival their VC-backed competitors. One key difference? They get to call the shots about when, where and how they work \xe2\x80\x94 and grow. Many of the founders also build their empires quietly, with more concern for creating great products than generating market buzz.
Clearly, bootstrapping isn\xe2\x80\x99t for everyone. Not every business can be self-funded, and sometimes, outside investment is exactly the right choice. We all need to chart our own paths. But bootstrappers remind us to question the prevailing startup narratives and ask, \xe2\x80\x9cDo we really need to raise VC money?\xe2\x80\x9d
It\xe2\x80\x99s well worth taking a breath, setting the pitch deck aside for a moment, and considering an alternative route.
Starting a business isn\xe2\x80\x99t easy. There are risks, challenges, and complications, whether you leverage your own cash or you pursue venture capital. Reading headline after headline about record-setting funding rounds, however, can make VC backing look glamorous \xe2\x80\x94 and perhaps even necessary.
Most of us can name the well-funded success stories: Facebook, Google, WhatsApp, Alibaba, Rent the Runway, Uber, and more. But for every famous brand, there are thousands of VC-funded firms that quietly grew and then fizzled. That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s good to take a clear-eyed look at the statistics.
Research by Harvard lecturer Shikhar Ghosh reveals that about 75% of VC-backed companies in the U.S. fail, meaning they don\xe2\x80\x99t return the investors\xe2\x80\x99 capital. If we define failure as not delivering the projected return on investment, however, then more than 95% of startups fail, says Ghosh.
Just like a bicycle, a startup requires some speed to stay upright. But once a founder accepts outside cash, the clock really starts ticking.
Here\xe2\x80\x99s another way to think about it. If VC funding is the fabled hare, then bootstrapping is the tortoise. It\xe2\x80\x99s slow and steady, but it keeps on going (and going and going).
We know that premature scaling is the number one cause of startup failure. Eager new founders often drain their cash on big offices, the latest technology, splashy PR and marketing campaigns, and hiring full teams \xe2\x80\x94 long before they\xe2\x80\x99re ready or even need the support. Sometimes their investors push for these outward signs of accomplishment.
Bootstrappers rarely face the same pressures. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have to meet arbitrary timelines or show hockey stick growth charts. Instead, they have the freedom to set their own targets. They make the rules, and, most importantly, they decide what \xe2\x80\x9csuccess\xe2\x80\x9d looks like \xe2\x80\x94 even if that definition is constantly evolving.
Clearly, bootstrapping doesn\xe2\x80\x99t eliminate all problems. To grow a business without external funding, you have to swim, or you\xe2\x80\x99ll sink fast. You have to be creative and strategic, but that can also make you a better entrepreneur. Here are three more advantages of taking the self-funded route.
It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if you\xe2\x80\x99re a designer, product engineer, developer, or a UX specialist. As a bootstrapped founder, you\xe2\x80\x99re probably also shipping packages, answering calls, and writing social media posts. That\xe2\x80\x99s how it goes. And while spending precious time on the \xe2\x80\x9cother stuff\xe2\x80\x9d can be frustrating, it ensures you understand every corner of the business. Once it\xe2\x80\x99s time to hire someone for that role, you know exactly what to look for and what to avoid.
*Quick tip: At JotForm, we hire and grow slowly. And we hire someone only when we have their entire first-year salary in the bank. It\xe2\x80\x99s a simple rule of thumb that has helped to keep us on track.
The classic (or clich\xc3\xa9d) startup office is a former industrial space with exposed beams and high ceilings. It\xe2\x80\x99s bright and it shows the company is Doing. Big. Things. Until a business truly needs that kind of space, however, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a smart expense.
It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to get distracted, but bootstrappers can make strategic choices, like using open-source software and upgrading later, if necessary. Or working from home, renting a desk in a co-working space, and doing the PR and accounting until you can afford to get help.
In the early stages of a startup, the business is still pliable. You can release a product, gather user feedback, and adapt to real market needs. That\xe2\x80\x99s an advantage.
Entrepreneurs often chase perfection, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not only impossible; it can put your company at risk.
New founders should release their products as soon as possible. Don\xe2\x80\x99t even try to make it perfect. Hundreds of startups have adapted and pivoted their way to success:
When startups work obsessively to create the \xe2\x80\x9cultimate\xe2\x80\x9d first release, they can also be tempted to argue with their customers \xe2\x80\x94 even when customers share honest feedback about what they want and need. That\xe2\x80\x99s why staying lean and flexible can be a major business advantage.
After college, I spent five years working as a programmer for a New York-based media company. I learned so much there: how my mentors accomplished their goals and how to collaborate with team members. I also saw how micromanagement destroys staff motivation. Most importantly, that\xe2\x80\x99s where I got the idea for JotForm.
Both startup press and social media often advise founders to leap blindly into business as soon as they have an idea. That approach can work, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a tough slog that kills lots of promising companies. Instead, there are five steps you can take \xe2\x80\x94 right now \xe2\x80\x94 to lay the foundation for lasting success.
Writing a manifesto and leaving your job with a flourish, Jerry Maguire-style, might seem like a badass entrepreneurial move. Unfortunately, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t even work for Jerry.
Most bootstrappers test the waters with a side project while they hold down a full-time gig. They leave the safety of a regular paycheck only when that side hustle can provide viable, long-term income. SpaceX, Apple, Product Hunt, Trello, WeWork, Craigslist and Twitter all started this way.
Never underestimate how much you can learn and accomplish in a 9-to-5 job \xe2\x80\x94 and let\xe2\x80\x99s all agree to stop saying \xe2\x80\x9cday job\xe2\x80\x9d like it\xe2\x80\x99s a four-letter word. Getting paid to sharpen your skills at a healthy, productive company can provide a great foundation for whatever you\xe2\x80\x99re building.
At Google, employees can spend 20% of their time exploring new ideas or creative projects. This 20% time policy is well known in tech circles, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a concept we can all apply to our work lives.
We can build entire businesses by tinkering on the side, but most importantly, side projects boost creativity. When there\xe2\x80\x99s no pressure to meet a revenue target (or make any money at all), we\xe2\x80\x99re free to play, explore and learn. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great way to decide whether the project truly captures your imagination, and to gauge outside interest.
In fact, side projects should be stupid, says ex-Spotify product designer Tobias van Schneider:
\xe2\x80\x9cThe only way a side project will work is if people give themselves permission to think simple, to change their minds, to fail \xe2\x80\x94 basically, to not take them too seriously.
When you treat something like it\xe2\x80\x99s stupid, you have fun with it, you don\xe2\x80\x99t put too much structure around it. You can enjoy different types of success.\xe2\x80\x9d
We should never be afraid to invest time and energy into something that excites us; something that gets the blood pumping and our creativity flowing. Follow curiosity and see where it leads.
And if enabling \xe2\x80\x9cstupidity\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work, trying looking at the side project through a more scientific lens.
Don\xe2\x80\x99t focus on the outcome or how the experiment will be received. Just start.
Even before it\xe2\x80\x99s done, and long before it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cready,\xe2\x80\x9d we need to share our ideas. Show people what you\xe2\x80\x99ve been working on \xe2\x80\x94 this was one of the strategies that helped us to land our first 1,000 users. Take them inside the experiments you\xe2\x80\x99re running, no matter how early or unpolished.
Today, there are so many different and inexpensive ways to share. Pick your favorite platform \xe2\x80\x94 the one that feels natural, and where you spend time anyway. It could be a YouTube channel, an Instagram account, a podcast, or even a blog. I have my blog on Medium but it could be whatever other network that works for you.
The simple act of sharing can help you to:
As we collect that paycheck and play with new ideas, it\xe2\x80\x99s the perfect time to learn. Never before have there been so many expert voices and resources, right at our fingertips. We can take online courses, read blogs, watch videos, attend meetups, listen to interviews, and read books. Find mentors (both real and virtual) and soak up every bit of knowledge possible. Then, apply what you lean and keep experimenting.
Contrary to prevailing wisdom (and motivational quotes), the best startups aren\xe2\x80\x99t driven by passion; they solve problems. We built JotForm to eliminate a friction point that I experienced firsthand, while working at the media company.
Back in the late \xe2\x80\x9990s, building custom web forms was tedious and time-consuming, so I envisioned a drag-and-drop tool that anyone could use. I knew people wanted the product, because it solved a problem we struggled with every day.
Investor and Y Combinator co-founder Paul Graham says the most successful business ideas share three common features: They\xe2\x80\x99re something the founders themselves want, that they themselves can build, and that few others realize are worth doing.
\xe2\x80\x9cThe verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not \xe2\x80\x98think up\xe2\x80\x99 but \xe2\x80\x98notice,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d writes Graham. \xe2\x80\x9cAt YC we call ideas that grow naturally out of the founders\xe2\x80\x99 own experiences \xe2\x80\x98organic\xe2\x80\x99 startup ideas. The most successful startups almost all begin this way.\xe2\x80\x9d
Ask yourself:
What problems have you experienced in the world?
What problems do you have with products, services, and even yourself?
Problems need smart solutions. Passion is just the icing on the cake.
The RXBar also came from a personal need. Company CEO and co-founder Peter Rahal wanted a deliciously simple protein bar free of chemicals or synthetic ingredients. So, he developed a nutritious bar that would satisfy the CrossFit-going, paleo-eating crowd \xe2\x80\x94 and himself.
Rahal and his business partner, Jared Smith, scratched their own itch. As Basecamp founders Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson write in their bestselling book, Rework, \xe2\x80\x9cthe easiest, most straightforward way to create a great product or service is to make something you want to use.\xe2\x80\x9d
Once you have a prototype, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to ensure you have an eager customer today , not sometime in the future.
If you can\xe2\x80\x99t answer the question, \xe2\x80\x9cwho needs this right now?\xe2\x80\x9d it might not be a viable business. For example, Rahal kept re-mixing his recipes until they tasted incredible. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop until he knew people would pay for the product \xe2\x80\x94 and he tested that threshold by selling the bars door to door, packaged only in Tupperware.
Using what you create can be a game-changer. And it sounds so simple; after all, who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use the product they built? But a startup has so many moving parts that founders can quickly become detached from their original mission.
Once a product or service is shipping, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to stay close to the heart of your offering. Use it, consume it, order it, and dig into the details. Engagement puts you back in the customer\xe2\x80\x99s shoes, so you experience any problems firsthand. It also keeps the team (no matter how small) on its toes.
Additionally, If the startup was built to scratch your own itch, there are always more opportunities to extend the solution. Ask yourself:
How else could this product serve me, personally?
What would make this solution more valuable \xe2\x80\x94 both to current and potential customers?
Very few problems in life are tackled once and solved forever. Startups aren\xe2\x80\x99t stagnant, either. They need to evolve with needs, culture and markets. When you keep mining the problem (and the solution), it can keep the business fresh and vibrant.
Sonny and Cher. Bert and Ernie. Calvin and Hobbes. Thelma and Louise.
Pop culture loves a good duo. So does the startup world.
Investors like Paul Graham often want to back businesses run by partners with complementary skills. Apple, for example, paired the late, sales-savvy Steve Jobs with Steve Wozniak, who focused on technology.
But when co-founders don\xe2\x80\x99t gel, the results can be disastrous. \xe2\x80\x9cStartups do to the relationship between the founders what a dog does to a sock,\xe2\x80\x9d says Graham. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it can be pulled apart, it will be.\xe2\x80\x9d
According to Noam Wasserman, a professor at Harvard Business School, 65% of high-potential startups fail due to conflict among the founders. Wasserman studied 10,000 entrepreneurs for his book, The Founder\xe2\x80\x99s Dilemma, and suggests that multiple founders bring more skills to the table, but they also have more potential for disputes over money, strategy, leadership, credit, and other issues.
It makes sense. Multiple founders can get behind the wheel, but they have to agree on the destination, plus everything from who\xe2\x80\x99s in the back seat to the best driving route. Many founders also have a strong desire for freedom, which can quickly feel stifled when someone else weighs in on every detail.
\xe2\x80\x9cPicking a co-founder is your most important decision,\xe2\x80\x9d says Naval Ravikan, co-founder of the AngelList platform. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s more important than the product, market, and investors.\xe2\x80\x9d
Ravikan makes a bold statement. Not everyone would agree that the partnership matters more than the product \xe2\x80\x94 or the market. But starting a business is a massive commitment. You\xe2\x80\x99re picking someone with whom to share your life\xe2\x80\x99s work. You\xe2\x80\x99ll also share money, space, risk, and a whole lot of time.
The right partnership is powerful. Working with the wrong person can feel heavy and frustrating (at the very least) and, in the worst case, it can destroy the business.
That\xe2\x80\x99s why a founders\xe2\x80\x99 agreement should be excruciatingly detailed. Hire an experienced lawyer, if you go this route, and plan for everything: equity breakdown, vesting schedules, intellectual property, termination clauses, and more. Ensure that everyone is clear on the terms and feels fully protected, should the partnership go south.
If you\xe2\x80\x99re not sure about a potential co-founder, there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to rush. As I explained in Why you don\xe2\x80\x99t need a co-founder to start your own business , take your time and see how it feels to work on your own.
Forget what the VCs say \xe2\x80\x94 especially if you\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to bootstrap. As Ravikan says, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99re compromising, keep looking. A company\xe2\x80\x99s DNA is set by the founders, and its culture is an extension of the founders\xe2\x80\x99 personalities.\xe2\x80\x9d
Entrepreneurs who do trust themselves to go solo are often rewarded with the ultimate freedom. Spanx founder Sara Blakely, for example, built a global company without a co-founder or any outside investment. At age 41, she became the youngest self-made female billionaire \xe2\x80\x94 and she still owns 100% of the company.
Entrepreneurs, of all people, should know that rules are meant to be broken. That\xe2\x80\x99s half the fun. So, partner up or stay solo, but do it on your terms, with your eyes wide open.
Most startup experts worship at the altar of rapid expansion. They even have a pattern for it, called \xe2\x80\x9chockey stick growth,\xe2\x80\x9d which occurs when revenues start out flat and then quickly shoot up to create that iconic curve.
\xe2\x80\x9cAiming for hockey-stick growth, while being aware of the predictable stages of growth, is exactly what successful entrepreneurs should do,\xe2\x80\x9d writes entrepreneur Bobby Martin, author of The Hockey Stick Principles .
Investors dream about rapid growth, too. They want to recover their money fast, so they often pressure companies to expand quickly.
A hockey stick looks great on paper, but it typically requires the business to grow revenues first and figure out profits later. That can put the company at risk. Bootstrappers take the opposite approach. They sort out profits first and stay focused on that key goal.
Slow growth takes patience and a good dose of bravery. It\xe2\x80\x99s normal to feel some FOMO as you watch other firms double, then triple their staff overnight. But slow growth can provide stability. It also enables founders to sleep well at night, spend time with the people they love, and create products that attract loyal, satisfied customers.
Here are four more reasons to take the slow road.
Bootstrapping math is pretty simple: spend less than you earn and you can grow at your own pace. It\xe2\x80\x99s simple, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not effortless.
When we celebrate companies that raise millions and post huge vanity metrics, like user acquisitions, that math can seem almost too simple.
Glorifying hockey stick growth also implies that you can chase flashy numbers now and worry about profits later. In today\xe2\x80\x99s market, it\xe2\x80\x99s not uncommon to hear the question, \xe2\x80\x9chow, exactly, do they make money?\xe2\x80\x9d
But profits provide freedom \xe2\x80\x94 even when they\xe2\x80\x99re modest. Make decisions that keep your company in the black, right from day one. After all, a bootstrapped business needs to work, because there are no hefty bank deposits to fall back on.
Newly-funded companies often face pressure to fill every seat \xe2\x80\x94 immediately. \xe2\x80\x9cHire fast, fire faster\xe2\x80\x9d has even become a startup mantra. There\xe2\x80\x99s a sense that Christmas is coming, so Santa better hire as many elves as possible. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if they\xe2\x80\x99re out of work by February.
Building the right team is essential. These are the people who will build and nurture the product. They\xe2\x80\x99ll implement new ideas and interact with customers. As Todoist founder Amir Salihefendic says, \xe2\x80\x9cOptimize on output. Don\xe2\x80\x99t optimize on the number of people you hire.\xe2\x80\x9d
Caring about customers is good for business. That\xe2\x80\x99s not a tagline; it\xe2\x80\x99s an effective way to bootstrap. VC-backed companies often start out with deep knowledge of their audience. Over time, though, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to confuse what customers want with what investors want.
If you believe that growth reigns supreme, then it will quickly become the primary focus.
\xe2\x80\x9cTraction and product development are of equal importance and should each get about half of your attention,\xe2\x80\x9d says Gabriel Weinberg, a successful CEO and the author of Traction. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is what we call the 50 percent rule: spend 50 percent of your time on product and 50 percent on traction.\xe2\x80\x9d
Very few people are born knowing exactly how to lead \xe2\x80\x94 or to design, code, market, sell, and build. Aggressive growth can quickly highlight those knowledge gaps, which are totally okay. Most people launch businesses to create a smart solution, not because they want to run staff meetings.
Growingly slowly enables you to learn alongside your team. You can learn how to manage and motivate those people, too. Mistakes can also be smaller when you\xe2\x80\x99re not feeling the heat from investors, or you suddenly see 50 new faces in the office, all eager for direction. Take your time and you can:
Customers. As we focus on funding options, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to leave end users out of the conversation. Even the term \xe2\x80\x9cusers\xe2\x80\x9d dehumanizes the people who will buy what we create. But bootstrapped companies ultimately answer to their customers, not to investors. We have an obligation to listen closely to customer needs , feedback , and ideas \xe2\x80\x94 and that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing.
Even criticism is great for business, because it pushes the team to stretch and innovate. Customer-funded growth keep us honest; they ensure we don\xe2\x80\x99t stray off track. That\xe2\x80\x99s a powerful advantage.
Never assume you know what customers want; you have to look at the data. We\xe2\x80\x99re lucky to live in an era where we can create a hypothesis and then test it without overt bias. Making a product change? Release it to a small group and establish a clear way to measure user reactions. Apply what you learn and test again.
Testing doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you\xe2\x80\x99re beholden to customer whims, either. You create the \xe2\x80\x9cwhat,\xe2\x80\x9d and customers help to show you \xe2\x80\x9chow.\xe2\x80\x9d For example, Airbnb\xe2\x80\x99s mission is to create \xe2\x80\x9ca world where people can belong through healthy travel that is local, authentic, diverse, inclusive and sustainable.\xe2\x80\x9d How, exactly they do that is still up to the smart people running the company.
According to surveys conducted for American Express:
The numbers are clear: customer service matters deeply. Support teams do much more than resolve tickets and answer tedious questions; they have a massive effect on company growth.
Sexy customer acquisition stats usually get the spotlight, but it\xe2\x80\x99s better to spend time, energy, and money on satisfying existing customers than winning over new ones. In fact, data shows that it\xe2\x80\x99s anywhere from 5 to 25 times more expensive to acquire a new customer than to keep a current one.
Extraordinary customer support doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even require extraordinary efforts; you just need to consistently exceed expectations:
Bootstrapping is not a great way to get PR. And most self-funded entrepreneurs are too busy refining their product to worry about landing on magazine covers.
A little publicity certainly never hurts but what does the attention really do \xe2\x80\x94 especially if it\xe2\x80\x99s about the business, not the product itself? Most customers don\xe2\x80\x99t read industry or tech publications anyway. Once the attention fades, you\xe2\x80\x99re still left with the same mission and the same challenges.
Highly-publicized funding rounds can also put you under a microscope. For example, Nasty Gal founder Sophia Amoruso made headlines in 2016 when her fashion brand filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, after raising $65 million over 10 years.
Now that she\xe2\x80\x99s launched a new venture, called Girlboss, both critics and fans are tracking her every move. Many other founders have been in Amoruso\xe2\x80\x99s shoes, too. Well-funded startups that crash and burn often make headlines. With serious money often comes serious scrutiny.
Big-time investments can supercharge the startup (for better or worse), but slow growth can ensure you have a sane, happy personal life \xe2\x80\x94 even as you build a thriving business. Here\xe2\x80\x99s why.
Most people think success requires 16-hour days. Typically, the opposite is true. Busy and effective are not the same thing \xe2\x80\x94 even though \xe2\x80\x9cbusyness\xe2\x80\x9d has become a modern-day status symbol.
\xe2\x80\x9cHustle might move you forward, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t set you up for sustainable success,\xe2\x80\x9d says Kyle Young, author of QuitterProof. \xe2\x80\x9cGood habits are formed through consistency and repetition, not mindless effort.\xe2\x80\x9d
Many of the world\xe2\x80\x99s greatest innovators (past and present) dedicated large amounts of time to simply thinking. Reflecting. Strategizing and planning. Bill Gates originally made the Think Week famous. Now, other founders, like Skillshare\xe2\x80\x99s Mike Karnjanaprakorn, have adopted this practice. Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Ferrriss have also followed suit.
Taking a digital sabbath can also keep you feeling rested and ready to play the long game. On Saturday, Sunday or another day of your choice, avoid technology in all forms. For example, power down your laptop and place it safely out of sight. Shut off your smartphone and hide it in a drawer. Change your Netflix password \xe2\x80\x94 and then try to forget it.

Founders are often hungry for success, but it takes time. Often, lots of time. A sustainable business model gives you the freedom to enjoy the ride. You can focus on building something you love, and that truly serves your customers, instead of racing toward empty growth targets.
\xe2\x80\x9cSo, what\xe2\x80\x99s your exit strategy?\xe2\x80\x9d
Entrepreneurs often hear this question before they\xe2\x80\x99ve earned a single dollar \xe2\x80\x94 and it can be disorienting. When you\xe2\x80\x99re still building a business you love, why would you think about selling it?
Just as there are marked differences between bootstrapped and VC-backed founders, \xe2\x80\x9cexit strategies\xe2\x80\x9d often divide entrepreneurs into two camps: those building to sell, and those who are in it for the long run.
Either scenario has merit. Business is personal, and we all need to make our own choices. Although some bootstrappers will eventually sell their firms, they rarely begin with this goal in mind.
\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s better than an exit strategy?\xe2\x80\x9d says Todoist founder Amir Salihefendic. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a long-term mission that your company truly cares about. It\xe2\x80\x99s focusing on building a company that can outlast you and creating something of true value.\xe2\x80\x9d
Create value first and valuation will follow. Bootstrapping forces you to develop a product that\xe2\x80\x99s worth paying for instead of trying to reach the top of TechCrunch or building a house of cards on a shaky foundation.
As I mentioned in Building my startup for 12 years: how to win the long game , you can retain your values, freedom and flexibility. You can learn from a slow-burning journey. You can focus on the long-term rather than the short.
A study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that unicorns (private companies valued above $1 billion) are roughly 50% overvalued. They\xe2\x80\x99re not generating billions of dollars in revenue, but thanks to deep-pocketed investments, paper valuations swell to reach that 10-figure sum.
Relying purely on estimates can be risky, because a sky-high valuation demands rapid scaling. And if the sky suddenly falls, VC-backed startups are often left in a vulnerable position. As Warren Buffet once said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only when the tide goes out that you can see who\xe2\x80\x99s been swimming naked.\xe2\x80\x9d
The media may glorify fast movers and big wins, but playing the long game is another type of victory. In fact, slow growth doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be a mere consequence of bootstrapping; it can be a smart, deliberate choice.
If you measure success against lofty goals, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to feel discouraged along the way and devastated if you don\xe2\x80\x99t reach them at all. Instead, each new milestone can be something to celebrate.
\xe2\x80\x9cThere is power in small wins and slow gains,\xe2\x80\x9d says James Clear. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is why average speed yields above average results. This is why the system is greater than the goal.\xe2\x80\x9d
It\xe2\x80\x99s worth exploring asking yourself:
For many bootstrappers, a harmonious work culture, plus total creative and financial freedom is the ultimate compensation.
In the hard-driving startup world, \xe2\x80\x9cculture\xe2\x80\x9d can be a clich\xc3\xa9 topic. Tech companies became infamous for installing foosball tables and offering craft beer on tap in exchange for gruelling work schedules. Superficial perks don\xe2\x80\x99t foster culture \xe2\x80\x94 or a healthy work-life balance.
At JotForm, we aim to work in a way that\xe2\x80\x99s sane, friendly and open. We keep normal hours and try to treat each other with deep respect. We also believe actions speak louder than words.
Enron Corporation \xe2\x80\x94 the American energy, commodities and services company \xe2\x80\x94 had four stated values: respect, integrity, communication and excellence. But those \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d values didn\xe2\x80\x99t save the company from a high-profile bankruptcy and auditing scandal that sent several top executives to prison.
Culture grows through big choices, like team structure, transparency, and product-focused goals. It also emerges through smaller actions, like when the founder preaches balance and leaves the office by 6 pm every night.
As you begin to grow and hire a team, here are five ways to encourage a rich, healthy startup culture:
Bootstrapping is just one way to build a business. Capital-intensive industries such as energy, transportation, telecommunications, and brick-and-mortar stores and restaurants often require funding. VC backing might also be the best way to achieve your business goals and personal ambitions.
For anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s eager to control their entrepreneurial destiny, bootstrapping can be an excellent choice. It worked for me, and I hope it can work for you, too.
Yes, it takes patience, drive, and determination. But the payoffs can include freedom (both financial and personal) and a better sense of work-life balance. You can grow at a sane pace and maintain a healthy personal life.
A self-funded business can also achieve great financial success. It might take more time, but the journey is often far more enjoyable. You can develop a product that improves people\xe2\x80\x99s lives and build a top-notch team to help you along the way. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to feel like an imposter, either, because there\xe2\x80\x99s time to learn and evolve with your business, not in spite of it.
Slow, sustainable growth is possible.
Stay focused on your product, trust in your abilities, and ask for help when you need it.
You can do this.
