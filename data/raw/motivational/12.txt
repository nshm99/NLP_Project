Tim Ferriss has made a wildly successful career out of improving himself, quantifying his progress, and pushing the boundaries of human productivity.
But in a recent interview with Clay Skipper from GQ, Ferriss acknowledges that he\xe2\x80\x99s been responsible for much of what he calls \xe2\x80\x9cthe noise in the self-improvement or self-optimization space.\xe2\x80\x9d
The \xe2\x80\x9cnoise\xe2\x80\x9d of self-improvement are the aspects that are a distraction from what truly matters. And, for Ferriss, that has meant a shift from searching for \xe2\x80\x9canswers to questions about how to do more (and do it more efficiently)\xe2\x80\x9d to focusing on what\xe2\x80\x99s happening \xe2\x80\x9cinside and helping you get comfortable being with yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d
\xe2\x80\x9cNot everything that is meaningful can be measured easily.\xe2\x80\x9d -Tim Ferriss
For many of us, discovering what matters most happens as we go through difficult times and realize what\xe2\x80\x99s working for us and what\xe2\x80\x99s not. For example, while having successfully \xe2\x80\x9cimproved himself\xe2\x80\x9d to the nth degree, and having experienced incredible success, Ferriss found that he still struggled with his mental health: \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly I found myself, after checking a lot of those boxes, still suffering.\xe2\x80\x9d
Whatever self-improvement methodologies Tim was using had ultimately been a distraction \xe2\x80\x94 noise \xe2\x80\x94 from what would aid him in his mental health struggle.
It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter how much money you have or how much you\xe2\x80\x99ve accomplished if you\xe2\x80\x99re still just as miserable and ashamed of who you are \xe2\x80\x94 distracting yourself from yourself. In this case, the money and accomplishments only prolong the suffering.
Much of what we call self-improvement is really just a band-aid for deeply rooted pain. And this pain is a seemingly universal experience of feeling unworthy.
Tara Brach\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8athe noted psychotherapist and meditation teacher\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8adescribes this unworthiness in her book Radical Acceptance:
\xe2\x80\x9cAs a friend of mine put it, \xe2\x80\x98Feeling that something is wrong with me is the invisible and toxic gas I am always breathing.\xe2\x80\x99 When we experience our lives through this lens of personal insufficiency, we are imprisoned in what I call the trance of unworthiness. Trapped in this trance, we are unable to perceive the truth of who we really are.\xe2\x80\x9d
Our root problem\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8aas Tara Brach describes\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8ais \xe2\x80\x98unworthiness\xe2\x80\x99. We feel that we are just not enough\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8athat we are uniquely flawed. And this is why self-improvement can so easily become a problem.
If I am uniquely flawed and I\xe2\x80\x99m ashamed of those flaws, then it is only normal that I will be attracted to anything that promises to help me \xe2\x80\x9cimprove\xe2\x80\x9d and to be \xe2\x80\x9cbetter\xe2\x80\x9d. But the vast majority of self-improvement does not address the roots of my feelings of unworthiness but rather distracts me from them.
And the thing is, this sort of self-improvement \xe2\x80\x9cworks\xe2\x80\x9d. You can experience short-term feelings of success and experience dopamine-fuelled highs that make you think everything\xe2\x80\x99s great. But, in time, your feelings of unworthiness will return \xe2\x80\x94 leaving you looking for another hit of \xe2\x80\x9cself-improvement\xe2\x80\x9d.
Any improvement that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t address your underlying sense of unworthiness is just noise. To live fully alive, you have to grapple with the genuine stuff of life \xe2\x80\x94 your own unique experience of unworthiness, shame, and discomfort at being alone with yourself.
And the way to \xe2\x80\x9cimprove\xe2\x80\x9d this sense of unworthiness is to accept it \xe2\x80\x94 to stop hiding it, fighting it, and compensating for it. Accepting ourselves as we are is a journey deeper than any productivity hack or supplement stack. It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult, scary, and \xe2\x80\x94 as Tara Brach writes \xe2\x80\x94 radical:
\xe2\x80\x9cClearly recognizing what is happening inside us, and regarding what we see with an open, kind and loving heart, is what I call Radical Acceptance. If we are holding back from any part of our experience, if our heart shuts out any part of who we are and what we feel, we are fueling the fears and feelings of separation that sustain the trance of unworthiness. Radical Acceptance directly dismantles the very foundations of this trance.\xe2\x80\x9d
This sense of unworthiness cannot be remedied with competition, productivity, or any form of external success. And any self-improvement philosophy or practice which is fundamentally about compensating for this inner pain will only ever fail to improve your experience of life, your happiness, and your peace.
However, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t to say that we must throw out the baby of self-improvement with the toxic bathwater we often find it in. Brach writes,
This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we can\xe2\x80\x99t compete in a healthy way, put whole hearted commitment into work or acknowledge and take pleasure in our own competence. But when our efforts are driven by the fear that we are flawed, we deepen the trance of unworthiness.
Tim Ferriss\xe2\x80\x99s goal has always been to quantify his journey so his followers could learn from him and progress faster. And with this recent revelation, it seems he has made a giant leap in that direction.
By exploring the vast universe of self-improvement and self-optimization and coming up short, Ferriss\xe2\x80\x99s new understanding serves as a lesson to us all: don\xe2\x80\x99t waste your time with the \xe2\x80\x9cnoise\xe2\x80\x9d. Instead, build a foundation of self-awareness and radical self-acceptance, and then you can consider enjoying the practical advantages of improving your productivity and external success.
The self-improvement world needs to change. In our tireless pursuit of improvement, we\xe2\x80\x99re often just masking our inner pain of unworthiness. Each of us knows this, to one degree or another. To move forward, we must turn off the noise and face our true selves without judgement \xe2\x80\x94 only then can we hope to experience any authentic change or improvement.
