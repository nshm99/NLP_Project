What is this dark art of personal development you speak of Mr. Tim? Put simply; it\xe2\x80\x99s the thing that will change your freaking life for real. No joke.Throw away the college books and forget about Google because all you need to understand is personal development.
It\xe2\x80\x99s become my obsession and it\xe2\x80\x99s what I do every single day that I have air in my lungs. It\xe2\x80\x99s the difference between the losers and the winners that wake up at 4 a.m. with their game face on ready to obliterate their goals with an Elon Musk like way of doing things.
You aren\xe2\x80\x99t broken, and we can fix you. Heck, we can fix each other! Empty your beer in the sink, grab a green juice and let\xe2\x80\x99s knock the benefits of personal development out together.
Here are the nine reasons why I became obsessed with personal development and you should too:
I\xe2\x80\x99m only preaching this magical thing called personal development because it works. If it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work, then I would shut the hell up about it. It\xe2\x80\x99s because it works though that I scream from the rooftop to wake up and get on the bandwagon.
It\xe2\x80\x99s the one thing I tried which actually worked. All the woo-woo chanting, affirmations and pretend positive thinking did nothing! It\xe2\x80\x99s all a hoax. Before personal development, I had an ugly scarcity mindset. When I learned to believe in the greater good and change the way I think, everything changedand I believe the same can happen for you, amigo.
From the outside, it appears that personal development is all about you. The deeper you get into it, the quicker you realize that it\xe2\x80\x99s about serving others.Your success is about what you do for others. Before you can do anything for others, though, you have to get yourself in order.
After you learn the basics, you\xe2\x80\x99ll no longer settle for selfishness or an inflated ego. All you\xe2\x80\x99ll think to yourself is \xe2\x80\x9cHow do I attract like minded people to come and change the world with me?\xe2\x80\x9d
If I had to break down personal development into one piece of information it would be this; it\xe2\x80\x99s all about progress. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. You make one small change per day towards your vision and then you take action. The action you take is automatic and often requires almost no thought.
The lack of thought comes from trusting yourself and learning not to over-think. As you start to see results, guess what? It\xe2\x80\x99s addictive. You become addicted to success.
All you need to do to master your life is to commit to being just a little bit better than you were yesterday. Don\xe2\x80\x99t fall for the delusion that you need to make humongous changes every day because you don\xe2\x80\x99t. If you try and do that early on in your transformation, you will burn out and give up.
Start small. Try lot\xe2\x80\x99s of new things and act like a kid again that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give a damn about anything other than having fun and discovering new things.
Before I drank the personal development Kool-Aid, everyone around me was ordinary. They were all failing and like me, they were pretending they weren\xe2\x80\x99t. Together we would post silly photos of us at nightclubs sculling beer and pretending life was great. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. We were miserable.
When I started learning about personal development, I met others in the same situation. Together, we grew and smashed our goals. Like a self-fulfilling prophecy, cool people magically started entering my life because they to wanted to share the good vibes.
Like attracts like, so do you want to attract the dregs or an infectious energy that will propel you beyond your wildest dreams?
Before personal development, I would experience pain like everyone else, but then I would allow myself to suffer. The pain is guaranteed, but the suffering is a choice. My default reaction to pain was to let it consume me, and I had no other references to get me out of a tough situation.
After beginning to embrace personal development, I learned the ancient art that goes back thousands of years and has never really changed. I then began to embrace fear and become vulnerable. I learned that our flaws are what make us awesome and we should never be ashamed of them.
Pain still comes around, it\xe2\x80\x99s just now I have the tools to deal with it.
Our mind\xe2\x80\x99s software is millions of years old, and it\xe2\x80\x99s never had an update. Through personal development, you learn how to force a software upgrade and understand the flaws of the way we are designed. The flaws are not all bad and are often there to protect us and shield us from danger.
Without going into the whole subject of our brain, the most important thing you will learn is that our mind spends most of its time thinking negative thoughts. The default response of our brain to any situation, without intervention, is to think in a negative way. No wonder we\xe2\x80\x99re so messed up.
By simply understanding this fact, and learning how to override the autopilot mode, you can win back your happiness, take back your life, and kick some serious butt!
I became obsessed with personal development because it taught me to avoid negative people and not try and please everyone. Even with personal development, some people will refuse to change. It\xe2\x80\x99s their choice, and we should respect that.
While you should never let money be your driving force, personal development will double if not triple your income. That\xe2\x80\x99s what it\xe2\x80\x99s done for me and I\xe2\x80\x99m positive it can do the same for you. Customers and companies want to pay you bucket loads of money when you become a magnet for everything that is good in this world.
The feeling is infectious and everyone wants to be around it. The money can help you make a bigger impact and enjoy life more. It can give you the resources you need to do extraordinary things. Most of all, you\xe2\x80\x99ll realize, the money means nothing, and you feel the same. All that matters is your dream.
It\xe2\x80\x99s very easy to take what we have for granted. We all want more money, sex, power, and good feelings. When your mind shifts from wanting more to realizing you already have enough, a subtle shift starts to occur.
You\xe2\x80\x99ll start to be grateful and express your gratitude towards others more often. You\xe2\x80\x99ll learn a secret weapon which is that whenever you feel horrible, you can shift your state by practicing gratitude.
In states of gratitude, the world slows down, your mind stops racing ahead and you see beauty in the simple pleasures of life. Now that\xe2\x80\x99s something to celebrate.
