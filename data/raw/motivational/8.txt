Goals. Are. Awesome.
Used right, they are effective tools for improving yourself and achieving your dreams.
For instance, I recently experimented with unreasonably high goals and found that they totally drive accomplishment.
I also feel that goals make any endeavor more exciting. They are like bacon: whatever you add them to, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to make it better.
But your goal shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the thing that\xe2\x80\x99s pulling you forward. If it is, then something is seriously wrong.
A goal is something that goes away once you hit it.
Goals condemn one to go through a process where one has an unsatisfied desire, works to satisfy the desire and experiences pleasant but temporary feelings of desire-satisfaction as a byproduct when one reaches the goal.
What follows, is a void:
\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the inner paradox of goals \xe2\x80\x94 they are valuable when we try to accomplish them, but someday they will disappear.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Charles Chu
If you need goals to feel like your existence has a purpose, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get addicted to them.
Some philosophers even think that humans cannot withdraw from the cycle of dissatisfaction \xe2\x86\x92 labor \xe2\x86\x92 goal-achievement and choose to stay happy.
I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s accurate, but in pointing to the emptiness of a goal-driven life, their argument relates to an important lesson \xe2\x80\x94 the truth of Buddhism.
I\xe2\x80\x99ve been meditating for over 10 years now and the mindfulness-mantra that \xe2\x80\x9call labels are fake\xe2\x80\x9d has always attracted me.
It sounds catchy and incredibly liberating, but when a non-meditating friend recently asked me to explain what it actually means I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to break it down.
To my own pleasure, when I was traveling from my hometown in the Netherlands to Budapest (where I\xe2\x80\x99m doing my doctorate), something clicked. In a strange way, the meaning of \xe2\x80\x98labels are fake\xe2\x80\x99 sheds light on how we can go wrong with goals.
What does \xe2\x80\x9clabel\xe2\x80\x9d mean? In this context, a \xe2\x80\x98label\xe2\x80\x99 means an \xe2\x80\x98evaluation\xe2\x80\x99. Something was \xe2\x80\x98successful\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98unsuccessful\xe2\x80\x99, you did \xe2\x80\x98well\xe2\x80\x99 or you \xe2\x80\x98screwed up\xe2\x80\x99. You \xe2\x80\x98made it\xe2\x80\x99 or you \xe2\x80\x98failed\xe2\x80\x99.
What does \xe2\x80\x9cfake\xe2\x80\x9d mean? (This is where it gets cool.)
In this context, \xe2\x80\x98fake\xe2\x80\x99 means not inherently existing. Such evaluations are not factual properties of states of affairs.
They are not really there.
If \xe2\x80\x9clabels\xe2\x80\x9d don\xe2\x80\x99t naturally exist, we can ask, \xe2\x80\x98What put them there?\xe2\x80\x99
The answer is \xe2\x80\x98goals\xe2\x80\x99. Goals put them there.
Without a goal, you can\xe2\x80\x99t fall short. Without a metric, you can\xe2\x80\x99t be inadequate.
These benchmarks, moreover, are projections of our mind.
They don\xe2\x80\x99t really exist.
That, I think, is the truth in the Buddhist lesson that labels are illusory.
The Buddha even takes it a step further: because suffering comes from wanting, we should eradicate desire.
The deduction that we could put an end to some pain if we would stop creating the possibility of failure, is apt. The conclusion that we, therefore, should stop fighting, is not.
Some struggles are worth it.
Which brings me to the deeper argument for why your motivation shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come from your goals.
The number one argument for why achieving goals shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be your core incentive is that
Goals are not the right cause for motivation
By itself, there is nothing good about achieving goals. Ticking off objectives has no intrinsic value. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter how fast you move if it\xe2\x80\x99s in a pointless direction.
Many people spend too much time on optimizing their strategy, and not enough on questioning whether they\xe2\x80\x99re chasing worthwhile aims in the first place.
If you need targets to bring in the energy and motivation, you\xe2\x80\x99re probably doing something that\xe2\x80\x99s not meaningful enough by itself.
What\xe2\x80\x99s pulling you forward should be your recognition that what you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to attain is worth it. Motivation should be a side effect of that.
The right reason for doing something is provided by facts about the thing that you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to achieve, which make it something that is worth achieving.
By the same token, making a goal out of something does not suddenly make it valuable or important. Many people have unimportant goals.
In a nutshell: there\xe2\x80\x99s a deep difference between achieving goals and achieving something of importance.
Don\xe2\x80\x99t lose sight of that.
