I\xe2\x80\x99m not highly motivated.
I don\xe2\x80\x99t have amazing willpower or self-control.
I don\xe2\x80\x99t get up at 6 am to read, meditate, drink a green smoothie, and run 10K.
That\xe2\x80\x99s because I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in motivation.
Instead, I\xe2\x80\x99ve built systems and habits that remove my internal drive from the equation. So, whether or not I feel \xe2\x80\x9cmotivated,\xe2\x80\x9d I can still be productive.
I realize that systems and habits are not a glamorous topic, but honestly, they work.
They\xe2\x80\x99ve fuelled every step of my entrepreneurial journey over the last 12 years \xe2\x80\x94 from the early days, when JotForm was just a simple idea, to growing a team of over 110 employees who serve 3.7 million users.
Habits and systems have made it all possible.
If you create reliable systems and continue to improve these systems (instead of your willpower), you don\xe2\x80\x99t even have to think about motivation.
Let\xe2\x80\x99s break it down a little.
In the simplest terms, motivation is your desire to do something. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sense of willingness that exists on a spectrum \xe2\x80\x94 from zero interest to a burning desire to take action.
When your desire is strong, motivation feels effortless.
But when you\xe2\x80\x99re struggling, just about anything sounds better than starting the assignment, making a tough phone call, or hitting the gym. Procrastination takes over \xe2\x80\x94 until the agony becomes overwhelming.
As Steven Pressfield writes in The War of Art,
\xe2\x80\x9cAt some point, the pain of not doing it becomes greater than the pain of doing it.\xe2\x80\x9d
I love this quote because I suspect we\xe2\x80\x99ve all felt this painful moment. That\xe2\x80\x99s when it\xe2\x80\x99s harder to stay on the couch than to get up, put on your sneakers, and go outside.
In his 2011 book, Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us, author Daniel Pink splits motivation into two different types: extrinsic and intrinsic.
Extrinsic motivation is external. It\xe2\x80\x99s money or praise or trying not to look clumsy on the tennis court.
Intrinsic motivation comes from within. It\xe2\x80\x99s the desire to act, even when the only reward is the activity itself (or completing a task).
Intrinsic motivation implies that you\xe2\x80\x99re acting for authentic, honorable reasons. For example, you start a business to help people or solve a problem \xe2\x80\x94 not because you\xe2\x80\x99re dazzled by visions of fame and fortune.
No matter how much you love your business, there are probably moments when you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take action.
Maybe it feels scary or impossible, or the task at hand is downright boring.
That\xe2\x80\x99s when systems can do the heavy lifting. Here are a few strategies that have helped me to build sustainable systems so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to rely on motivation.
Focus and motivation might seem like two different topics, but they are closely intertwined.
Take me as an example. This year, I have 3 work priorities:
These themes inform everything I do. If a project or an opportunity doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fit into one of these three buckets, I say no. Distractions slip away and I can make real progress.
For example, I spend the first two hours of every workday writing out my thoughts. It might be a problem I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to solve or a new idea. I don\xe2\x80\x99t book meetings during this period and I definitely don\xe2\x80\x99t answer emails.
But, if I arrive at work feeling less than inspired, I give myself permission to do something else \xe2\x80\x94 as long as it fits within my three focus areas. Instead of writing and problem-solving, I can read articles or books on these topics, meet with a product team, or watch a lecture.
All that thinking and exploring soon makes me feel more engaged. Once I\xe2\x80\x99m engaged, I come up with better ideas. And good ideas inspire me to take action.
This process isn\xe2\x80\x99t accidental. It\xe2\x80\x99s a simple feedback loop I use to get moving on days when my brain feels stuck in neutral.
In a 2016 article for The Cut, author Melissa Dahl shares,
\xe2\x80\x9cthe only motivational advice anyone has ever needed: You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to feel like getting something done in order to actually get it done.\xe2\x80\x9c
Go back and read that again, if you want. I know I did. Let it sink in.
It\xe2\x80\x99s surprisingly brilliant. Your feelings don\xe2\x80\x99t have to match your actions \xe2\x80\x94 especially when you truly want to move forward.
You could feel tired, but still put on your goggles and go for a swim. You could feel like you\xe2\x80\x99d rather staple yourself to the chair than build another PowerPoint deck \xe2\x80\x94 and you still get the presentation done.
Dahl also quotes Oliver Burkeman, author of The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can\xe2\x80\x99t Stand Positive Thinking, who writes:
\xe2\x80\x9cWho says you need to wait until you \xe2\x80\x98feel like\xe2\x80\x99 doing something in order to start doing it?
The problem, from this perspective, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that you don\xe2\x80\x99t feel motivated; it\xe2\x80\x99s that you imagine you need to feel motivated.\xe2\x80\x9d
Once again, this is where routines can outsmart feelings. Sure, you might feel like watching cat videos, but every morning, you sit down at your computer and open a blank document.
You write for two hours (or whatever your routine entails) and you don\xe2\x80\x99t bother taking your emotional temperature.
Progress ensues. Then you repeat, repeat, repeat.
The other day, I had a great idea during my morning workout. It was one of these eyebrow-raising lightbulb moments.
Unfortunately, it had nothing to do with my three focus areas I mentioned above. So, I made a note in my phone and asked our COO to follow my mental thread.
I was tempted to chase it myself, but I knew I had to stay focused.
I realize that delegation isn\xe2\x80\x99t always possible, especially when you\xe2\x80\x99re just starting out or money is tight. JotForm is a bootstrapped company.
We\xe2\x80\x99ve never taken a dime in outside funding, so I know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to watch every dollar.
But when it\xe2\x80\x99s possible, delegation can pay off, big time. Offload an activity if:
We\xe2\x80\x99ve talked a lot about everyday motivation. But how do you sustain your drive for the long run?
It\xe2\x80\x99s an important question. The answer will look a little different for everyone, but ultimately, we\xe2\x80\x99re all motivated by joy and meaning.
Guardian columnist (and The Antidote author) Oliver Burkeman first led me to Buddhist teacher Susan Piver. Tired of forcing herself to be \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d and master the daily to-do list, Piver decided instead to focus on the pleasure of her work:
\xe2\x80\x9cOnce I remembered that my motivation is rooted in genuine curiosity and my tasks are in complete alignment with who I am and want to be, my office suddenly seemed like a playground rather than a labor camp.\xe2\x80\x9d
She asked herself what would be fun to do and then focused on what she loved about each activity.
In the end, her day looked the same as it did when she was \xe2\x80\x9cdisciplined\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 but the experience was nearly effortless:
\xe2\x80\x9cYes, discipline is critical, just like all the teachers say.
And there is definitely stuff that needs doing that is just never going to be fun, like paying bills and cleaning the cat box.
But I suggest that instead of being disciplined about hating on yourself to get things done, try being disciplined about remaining close to what brings you joy.\xe2\x80\x9d
Talk about a perspective shift. We all go through tough times, work at jobs we don\xe2\x80\x99t love, and endure genuine unfairness.
But if you\xe2\x80\x99re struggling to do something you care deeply about, go easy on yourself.
Tap into why you started your business, or why you\xe2\x80\x99re flexing your creative muscles in the first place. It\xe2\x80\x99s a much happier way to move through your days.
To recap: establish your systems and habits. Stay focused on what matters. Delegate and tune out the noise. Your motivation will grow.
And if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t? You don\xe2\x80\x99t need it anyway.
