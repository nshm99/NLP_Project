Have you ever experienced a lightbulb moment? People describe these as moments of sudden inspiration, revelation, or recognition. I experienced my own lightbulb moment just a few days ago as I was reading Adam Grant\xe2\x80\x99s newest book, Think Again, which explores \xe2\x80\x9cthe power of knowing what you don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d
I was struck by a moment of recognition where I suddenly had the perfect words to describe something that I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have defined even an hour before.
For years I\xe2\x80\x99ve struggled to find the perfect words to summarize how I approach coaching and influencing others to change at work. When asked about my leadership style in interviews, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to come close to the \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d description, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve never quite hit the nail on the head. I always walk away with a nagging suspicion that the interviewer didn\xe2\x80\x99t really understand what I meant, and I only had myself to blame for that.
\xe2\x80\x9cI tend to influence others through questioning,\xe2\x80\x9d I would say when asked. \xe2\x80\x9cRather than telling them what I think outright, I help them draw their own conclusions by asking the questions that will help get them there.\xe2\x80\x9d

That description wasn\xe2\x80\x99t wrong, per se. But it didn\xe2\x80\x99t fully capture the nuance of how I influence those around me. Whether I\xe2\x80\x99m coaching employees, influencing peers, or persuading senior leaders, there has always been more of a method to my madness than my words did justice to.
It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until I came across a concept in Grant\xe2\x80\x99s latest book that the lightbulb turned on, and I suddenly had the words to describe what has become the core tenet of my approach to leading people; Motivational interviewing.
In psychological terms, motivational interviewing is a \xe2\x80\x9ccounseling method that helps people resolve ambivalent feelings and insecurities to find the internal motivation they need to change their behavior.\xe2\x80\x9d
And while I\xe2\x80\x99m not a counselor, I have spent my career working in human resources, which means some days feel like I am one \xe2\x80\x94 albeit without the degree.
In many ways, it\xe2\x80\x99s my job to influence the people around me to change just like a counselor might. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the employee who can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to hit deadlines, the senior leader who treats their team like garbage, or the colleague whose communication style is detrimental to the team\xe2\x80\x99s morale, my job is to help them find a better way to work. Leaders don\xe2\x80\x99t maintain the status quo; they influence change.
And while I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty good at doing this, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been really bad at explaining how exactly I do it. That is, until my lightbulb moment.
According to Grant, when it comes to motivational interviewing, \xe2\x80\x9cthe central premise is that we can rarely motivate someone to change. We\xe2\x80\x99re better off helping them find their own motivation to change.\xe2\x80\x9d
He says that when people ignore your advice \xe2\x80\x94 as they often do \xe2\x80\x94 it isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily because they disagree with the advice you\xe2\x80\x99re giving them.
\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes they\xe2\x80\x99re resisting the sense of pressure and the feeling that someone else is controlling their decision.\xe2\x80\x9d
The process of motivational interviewing relieves that pressure. And it\xe2\x80\x99s only once the burden of that pressure is removed that a person can claim the space needed to explore their motivations and decide to make a change unbridled by the expectations we put on them.
The process of motivational interviewing involves three techniques which are:
Here\xe2\x80\x99s how you can use this technique to help people find the motivation to change within themselves.
Those who know me best will tell you that they know whether I agree or disagree with a decision based on the number of open-ended questions I ask about it.
I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked for bosses that have taken a much more direct approach to express their disagreement with decisions. Frankly, observing this taught me what not to do.
Spoiler alert \xe2\x80\x94 Coming out of the gate by telling someone why you disagree with them and how they should think differently tends to shut people down pretty quickly.
Not only that, but it usually causes them to dig their heels in even further, anchoring themselves to their point-of-view.
Personally, I\xe2\x80\x99m less interested in explaining to someone why they\xe2\x80\x99re wrong and justifying why I\xe2\x80\x99m right. I\xe2\x80\x99m much more inclined to lean into humility and curiosity to make my point.
Grant says, \xe2\x80\x9cThe goal isn\xe2\x80\x99t to tell people what to do; it\xe2\x80\x99s to help them break out of overconfidence cycles and see new possibilities. Our role is to hold up a mirror so they can see themselves more clearly, and then empower them to examine their beliefs and behaviors.\xe2\x80\x9d
This is how we influence others to re-think their positions in a way that inspires change. By using open-ended questions to shine a light on their beliefs, Grant says, \xe2\x80\x9cthey develop more humility about their knowledge, doubt in their convictions, and curiosity about alternative points of view.\xe2\x80\x9d
Check, check, and check. We\xe2\x80\x99re well on our way to influencing change.
Grant explains that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen we try to convince people to think again, our first instinct is usually to start talking. Yet the most effective way to help others open their mind is often to listen.\xe2\x80\x9d
To do this well, Grant says we need to listen for \xe2\x80\x9cchange talk,\xe2\x80\x9d which is any talk \xe2\x80\x9creferencing a desire, ability, need, or commitment to make adjustments.\xe2\x80\x9d When we hear \xe2\x80\x9cchange talk,\xe2\x80\x9d our role is to ask about how and why that person might make a change and then listen intently and respond reflectively to what they say.
But being quiet and truly listening are two different things. Too often, we listen to respond. We listen just enough to prove our point or to prosecute theirs. Reflective listening requires us to tap into our natural curiosity while simultaneously resisting the temptation to fix or change others.
It requires a genuine interest in understanding the human being on the other end of the conversation.
Grant says that while many listeners are interested in making themselves look smart, \xe2\x80\x9cgreat listeners are more interested in making their audiences feel smart. They help people approach their own views with more humility, doubt, and curiosity.\xe2\x80\x9d
The result is that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen people have a chance to express themselves out loud, they often discover new thoughts.\xe2\x80\x9d
Only once you\xe2\x80\x99ve established a trusting relationship is it time to engage in a dialogue about change. Even then, it\xe2\x80\x99s not about pressuring the other person to accept your views. Instead, it\xe2\x80\x99s about having an empathetic and non-judgemental discussion that affirms the person\xe2\x80\x99s desire and ability to change.
In the book, Grant shares a series of motivational interviewing experiments. The findings showed that those who engaged in motivational interviewing \xe2\x80\x9cfelt less pressure to avoid contradictions in their thinking, which encouraged them to explore their opinions more deeply, recognize more nuances in them, and share them more openly.\xe2\x80\x9d
The thing is that whether we agree with someone\xe2\x80\x99s decision or not, their decision is just that \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s theirs.
We\xe2\x80\x99re there to help them explore their opinions more deeply, free from judgment, while simultaneously affirming our confidence in their ability to make an informed decision without our stamp of approval.
My style of influencing others has never been about being right. I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t have all the answers, nor do I claim to.
It has always been about helping other people re-examine their beliefs and behaviors in the spirit of making better collective decisions.

As Grant says, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we succeed in changing someone\xe2\x80\x99s mind, we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t only ask whether we\xe2\x80\x99re proud of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve achieved. We should also ask whether we\xe2\x80\x99re proud of how we\xe2\x80\x99ve achieved it.\xe2\x80\x9d
