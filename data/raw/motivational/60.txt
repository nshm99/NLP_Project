I read Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future over the summer. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fantastic read and a detailed account of the ups and downs of one of the biggest visionaries of our time.
It also gives you a sneak peek into Musk\xe2\x80\x99s work ethic and productivity secrets he uses to run multiple companies.
Now, Elon Musk is a smarter than average individual and has enormous ambition and drive. But I think that us\xe2\x80\x93mere mortals\xe2\x80\x93can incorporate some of his productivity secrets into our daily lives.
Here are the top 10 productivity secrets of Elon Musk and how you can apply them:
As the CEO of three companies \xe2\x80\x94 Tesla, SpaceX, and Neuralink \xe2\x80\x94 Elon Musk has a lot of things to stay on top on a day to day basis.
That\xe2\x80\x99s why he starts his day with his most critical work. For Musk, this means dealing with important emails that he needs to address in order to unblock other people\xe2\x80\x99s work and progress.
He typically starts the day at 7 a.m. and replies to critical emails for at least half an hour. Musk is careful to filter anything that is not deemed critical, focusing on only the most important items.
In his own words at the USC Commencement Speech:
\xe2\x80\x9cFocus on signal over noise. Don\xe2\x80\x99t waste time on stuff that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually make things better.\xe2\x80\x9d
Find your most important task (MIT) for the day and tackle it first. Your MIT should be the one thing that creates the most impact on your work.
For example:
My most important task is writing awesome content. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I always start the day by sitting down and writing. I won\xe2\x80\x99t move on to the next task before writing at least 1000 words.
What\xe2\x80\x99s your most important task? Use the 80/20 rule to help you figure it out and get in the habit of doing it before moving to anything else.
Musk has a very tight schedule, often working at different locations on any given day. That\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s constantly trying to optimize his time.
While admitting he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t read any books on time management, Musk shared some insightful advice on how to become better:
\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to have a feedback loop, where you\xe2\x80\x99re constantly thinking about what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done and how you could be doing it better. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the single best piece of advice: constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d
Musk incorporates not only his own feedback but also of others: he urges entrepreneurs to seek preferably negative feedback. While it might be hurtful at first, you normally end up getting a lot more out of it.
He also focuses on hiring the best people in any field that can provide consistent and truthful feedback.
Shortening the feedback loops lead to increased efficiency, faster implementation, and a better-finished product.
The great thing about this particular Elon Musk productivity secret is that it works for both your professional and personal life.
Gather your team and solicit feedback about a particular product, feature, management style, business process, or anything that you are currently trying to improve.
\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t tell me what you like, tell me what you don\xe2\x80\x99t like.\xe2\x80\x9d
You can do the same exercise with friends. And while the negative feedback may be wrong, you know they are simply trying to help you and it\xe2\x80\x99s well-intentioned.
A first principle is a basic assumption that can\xe2\x80\x99t be deduced from any other proposition. It\xe2\x80\x99s the only sure thing in a complex problem.
Musk reasons from first principles, rather than by analogy (such as previous experiences). This way you build your reasoning from the ground up:
\xe2\x80\x9cYou look at the fundamentals and construct your reasoning from that and then see if you have a conclusion that works or doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work. And it may or may not be different from what people have done in the past. It\xe2\x80\x99s harder to think that way, though.\xe2\x80\x9d
Here\xe2\x80\x99s an example of first principles reasoning, from Musk himself: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is a rocket made of? Aerospace-grade aluminum alloys, plus some titanium, copper, and carbon fiber. Then I asked, what is the value of those materials on the commodity market? It turned out that the materials cost of a rocket was around two percent of the typical price.\xe2\x80\x9d
Instead of buying a rocket for millions of dollars, Musk decided to purchase the raw materials for cheap and build the rockets himself in his own company.
And SpaceX was born.
Reasoning from first principles forces you to think differently. First Principles is about getting to the root cause of the problem. You have to break down the problem into its basic elements.
There are three main steps to apply this thinking framework:
If you want a deeper look into Musk\xe2\x80\x99s mind and reasoning by first principles, read one of my all-time favorite articles: The Cook and the Chef: Musk\xe2\x80\x99s Secret Sauce.
The first productivity hack gave you a slight hint for this one: Musk prefers to communicate on his own terms. That means defaulting to email and texts, both asynchronous ways of communication.
In his own words:
\xe2\x80\x9cI do love email. Wherever possible I try to communicate asynchronously. I\xe2\x80\x99m really good at email.\xe2\x80\x9d
He also makes himself hard to reach for people outside his company by using an obscure email address.
This lets him focus on actual work for his companies.
Progress comes from being focused and performing Deep Work. This means living as asynchronously as possible and with minimal interruptions from coworkers.
Here are three solutions to start working on your terms (in order of difficulty):
Minimize distractions in your daily life in order to make progress in meaningful work.
When Musk is not building rockets or revolutionizing the automobile industry, there\xe2\x80\x99s one place you can always find him: on email. He joked at a conference: \xe2\x80\x9cI do a lot of email \xe2\x80\x94 very good at email. That\xe2\x80\x99s my core competency\xe2\x80\x9d.
He is extremely clear, concise, and direct on his emails. As an example, read the email sent to his entire staff about the use of acronyms aptly called \xe2\x80\x9cAcronyms Seriously Suck\xe2\x80\x9d.
He frequently emails his entire company with updates, how to communicate, company visions and mission, and being more productive at work.
\xe2\x80\x9cPeople work better when they know what the goal is and why. It is important that people look forward to coming to work in the morning and enjoy working.\xe2\x80\x9d
He is also a master at public speaking, converting complex concepts into easy to understand language using an authentic voice. Musk often uses the present tense when talking about visionary topics, a language trick that excites the listener into feeling the future is now.
According to a study of Carleton University, a third of the workweek of the \xe2\x80\x9ctypical\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 knowledge worker is spent on email. That\xe2\x80\x99s why mastering communication over email is an art form.
You want to be succinct but also get your message across. In an email, every word counts. Here are some tips on how to master communication over email:
Musk multi-tasks strategically. Whenever possible, he combines several tasks together in a productivity hack known as batching. For example, he answers emails while eating or having a meeting over lunch.
Here\xe2\x80\x99s a quote from Elon on the subject:
\xe2\x80\x9cBut what I find is I\xe2\x80\x99m able to be with [my kids] and still be on email. I can be with them and still be working at the same time\xe2\x80\xa6 If I didn\xe2\x80\x99t, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to get my job done.\xe2\x80\x9d
Another example is going through emails and invoices while on phone meetings or interviews.
Studies have confirmed that multi-tasking is normally less efficient than single-tasking. The brain needs time to adjust when navigating different tasks, also known as task switching. Switching makes you tired and unproductive, not the tasks themselves.
But if you batch similar tasks that call for similar mindsets you can efficiently work on multiple tasks without losing your workflow. In other words, your brain is focused on one type of task at a time.
Here are a couple of examples:
To find more activities you can stack, write down all your general activities for the day and week and identify the ones that can be batched together. Try the batch a couple of times and rearrange tasks if necessary.
To process batches even faster, use the Pomodoro Technique.
Running three companies is no small feat, which means time is of the essence for Elon Musk. He is constantly trying to optimize his time using feedback loops.
Like many other ultra-productive and successful people, he follows a very detailed and specific daily schedule. He breaks his calendar into five-minute slots and finding your way into one of those openings is tough work.
He prioritizes engineering, design, and manufacturing, spending 80 percent of his time at work on those areas.
\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t spend my time pontificating about high-concept things; I spend my time solving engineering and manufacturing problems.\xe2\x80\x9d
By splitting his day into 5-minute chunks, Musk manages to get more tasks scheduled into his work.
The most productive people work from their calendar instead of a to-do list. Calendars are finite and give you a better sense of time, making it easier to determine how much time you have to complete projects during your week.
Breaking your days into small chunks and scheduling tasks on your calendar can boost your productivity. But you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to use 5-minute chunks. I found that the most efficient way of organizing my work is to break the days into 30-minute slots. Find a timing that works best for you and your work.
And make sure that you schedule everything: checking email, calling clients, lunch, and meetings. Everything goes on your calendar.
Rip to-do lists and instead work from your calendar.
Perhaps one of Musk\xe2\x80\x99s most notorious character traits is his tendency to set incredibly ambitious deadlines for his companies\xe2\x80\x99 projects. He uses stretch goals as a way to change perception:
\xe2\x80\x9cThe first step is to establish that something is possible; then probability will occur.\xe2\x80\x9d
Here\xe2\x80\x99s a story from a former SpaceX executive: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like he has everyone working on this car that is meant to get from Los Angeles to New York on one tank of gas. They will work on the car for a year and test all of its parts. Then, when they set off for New York after that year, all the vice presidents think privately that the car will be lucky to get to Las Vegas. What ends up happening is that the car gets to New Mexico \xe2\x80\x94 twice as far as they ever expected \xe2\x80\x94 and Elon is still mad. He gets twice as much as anyone else out of people.\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis mine)
The last sentence illustrates the power of stretch goals. Even in the face of failure, your goal was so outrageous, so impossible to achieve, that you celebrate the small achievements you made because you expected that nothing would come out of it.
The initial plan of Tesla was to start shipping the Roadster in 2006. The company pushed that deadline back several times until the car actually became available in 2008. Even though they released its car almost two years after the deadline, Tesla delivered the first completely battery-powered electric car.
In his own words:
\xe2\x80\x9cI say something, and then it usually happens. Maybe not on schedule, but it usually happens.\xe2\x80\x9d
Musk\xe2\x80\x99s stretch goals have given us a world where one of the best cars you can buy is electric, and where we finally have reusable rockets: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Henry Ford made cheap, reliable cars, people said, \xe2\x80\x98Nah, what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with a horse?\xe2\x80\x99 That was a huge bet he made, and it worked.\xe2\x80\x9d
Setting goals that maintain the status quo doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get you reusable rockets.
The intention of setting stretch goals is to push yourself outside the comfort zone. Growth doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen when you keep doing what you\xe2\x80\x99ve already done in the past. It comes from failing while trying to make progress. If you aim to achieve five great things and only succeed at two of them, you are outperforming all the people who never tried in the first place.
Stretch goals demand more quantity and quality of work and force you to innovate more often than ordinary goals. And in the pursuit of it, you grow your skills to where they need to be in order to get it done.
At first, you won\xe2\x80\x99t know how ambitious your stretch goals should be. Using trial and error, understand how much past your limits you should push. But the most important thing is to start trying and then adjust as you go.
Next time you are making plans for work, take a few extra minutes to include a stretch goal. Try to push yourself to perform 50% better than your normal goal requires. Go big and see if you can surprise yourself with incredible performance. Using this strategy is the first step towards smashing goals and reaching targets you didn\xe2\x80\x99t even think were possible!
In 2004, Musk called a supplier to get the price of an electromechanical actuator. The supplier quoted $120,000.
Reasoning from first principles, Musk broke down the components needed and asked Steve Davis, now SpaceX\xe2\x80\x99s director of advanced projects, to build one from scratch for under $5,000. Davis spent nine months designing and building the actuator for $3,900, which flew to space inside the Falcon 1 rocket.
Elon Musk is never satisfied with where he is now. His companies have had enormous achievements, but Musk knows that there\xe2\x80\x99s always room for improvement \xe2\x80\x94 in every area. There\xe2\x80\x99s always a better, faster, or cheaper way to do things:
\xe2\x80\x9cYou should take the approach that you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong. Your goal is to be less wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d
This is what is called a growth mindset, an important skill that separates successful people from everyone else. When you have a growth mindset, you know you can learn anything if you put enough effort into it. And if you fail, you approach the problem from a different angle until you find a solution that works. You iterate until you get it right.
In Musk\xe2\x80\x99s words:
\xe2\x80\x9cFailure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough.\xe2\x80\x9d
The opposite is known as a fixed mindset, where the status quo is rarely challenged. Things will always be the way they are because \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s how we do things around here\xe2\x80\x9d. Preconceived notions are taken as universal truths, instead of being questioned. Thus, people stagnate.
On the other hand, developing a growth-oriented mindset brings progress to both our personal and professional lives. And even if you manage small gains each day are small, they compound over time. A 1% gain every day compounds to almost 3800% increase over a year.
Growth comes from tackling difficult problems, questions, and challenges. In order to succeed, you need to train the brain to look at failures and struggles as progress, as getting closer to the solution.
Here\xe2\x80\x99s how you can start developing a growth mindset:
According to his brother, Musk used to read 2 books a day from an early age. In other words: he devoured knowledge. This led to a wide understanding of many sciences, such as physics, math, engineering, and computer science.
One of my favorite quotes is about how he describes knowledge:
\xe2\x80\x9cIt is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree \xe2\x80\x94 make sure you understand the fundamental principles, ie the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.\xe2\x80\x9d
Even when running his companies, Musk constantly tries to learn from the people around him that have more knowledge on a specific topic. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a passage from the book: \xe2\x80\x9cHe would trap an engineer in the SpaceX factory and set to work grilling him about a type of valve or specialized material. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought at first that he was challenging me to see if I knew my stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kevin Brogan, one of the early engineers. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I realized he was trying to learn things. He would quiz you until he learned ninety percent of what you know.\xe2\x80\x9d
Over the years, Musk developed T-shaped skills: a lot of knowledge in one particular field and a substantial amount of knowledge in many other disciplines and topics. This allowed him to be world-class in one field (business) but also use his broad knowledge to innovate, find different solutions, be more creative, and collaborate with experts in other fields effectively.
Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with a practical example: you want to be healthy. In order to be healthy, practicing just one sport isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to cut it. You need to know a whole lot of skills: you need to learn the basics of a good diet, how to develop muscle, flexibility, different cardio, condition, etc. While you have deep knowledge in a particular field \xe2\x80\x94 the sport \xe2\x80\x94 , you also developed broad knowledge in many other areas which are the basis on being healthy. This is the T-shaped skills approach.
Let\xe2\x80\x99s look at someone who works in Marketing or Growth: deep knowledge in acquisition channels such as PPC, SEO, and viral loops, while also having broad knowledge over other topics such as statistics, some programming, design principles, and copywriting.
Here\xe2\x80\x99s how you can develop T-shaped skills in your area:
One of the most upvoted questions on the 2015 Reddit AMA with Musk was:\xe2\x80\x9cWhat daily habit do you believe has the largest positive impact on your life?\xe2\x80\x9d To which Musk simply replied: \xe2\x80\x9cShowering.\xe2\x80\x9d
In another interview, Musk admitted the shower is where he normally comes up with the best ideas: \xe2\x80\x9cThis sounds really cliche, but like, the shower is probably like the most\xe2\x80\xa6 wake up, go shower in the morning and I think so what\xe2\x80\x99s really happened is things have percolated in the subconscious and it\xe2\x80\x99s not really occurring in the shower but you\xe2\x80\x99re kinda getting the results from last night\xe2\x80\x99s you know, computation, basically.\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis mine)
I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the lesson in productivity from showering: your brain has been working all night for you, trying to come up with solutions in the background. It takes a few minutes to turn \xe2\x80\x9con\xe2\x80\x9d and that can happen during the shower, helping you see challenges with more clarity.
It also provides you with quiet time to think right after refreshing your brain. You can use it to plan the day ahead or think about solutions for problems you might face during the day ahead, for example.
\xe2\x80\x9cI think it is possible for ordinary people to choose to be extraordinary.\xe2\x80\x9d
Stay blessed, and stay inspired!
