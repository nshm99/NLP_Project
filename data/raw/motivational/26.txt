A while back, our team polled over 1000 people who invested in personal development seminars/ courses, set goals, and worked on those goals for 90 days. The data from those polls was pretty shocking- 96% of their personal development efforts completely failed.
There\xe2\x80\x99s a joke that goes \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m opening a gym called Resolutions. It will have exercise equipment in it for the first two weeks and then it turns into a bar for the remainder of the year.\xe2\x80\x9d
It\xe2\x80\x99s funny because culturally, we know it\xe2\x80\x99s a thing- but quantifying it helped understand to what extent. But what exactly is the reason for this? And more importantly, how can we prevent it?
Much of this has to do with your personality types. Just like our bodies wildly vary in size, likelihood of heart disease, and fat retention, our personalities are much the same way. So let\xe2\x80\x99s start with a breakdown of the major types of people we run into.
These types have a natural bias towards action. By and large, these are the people who hit their goals. Many imperfect actions will get you far further than not doing anything at all. In fact, a daily habit of writing or training at the gym is just that- taking action, rarely ever perfect, day after day. These people are likely to change whether they read the self-help book, go to the seminar, or not. But they still read books and attend conferences because they understand and practice the principle of the slight edge: the little things they to do repeatedly lead to big changes in their lives.
This group of people change because of the effort they put into their personal development. Taking big action doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come naturally to this group, as it does for the first. If the right seminar, coach, teacher or mentor lights a fire under their ass, they change and they become people in the first group. Often that nudge, or initial momentum is enough to get people moving. This is a tricky place to be because while external motivation is fine to get started, these people will have to find the discipline to stay on top of their habits- especially for the majority of the time when they don\xe2\x80\x99t feel motivated. For this group, optimizing their environments is key. More on that shortly.
Dan Kennedy says a good amount of the people that buy his products never remove the shrink-wrap. There are other people who spend their entire lives going from one personal development seminar to another, but nothing ever changes.
These people believe in the myth of the \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve made it\xe2\x80\x9d moment. They think that the next course, book, or seminar will transform them in an instant, into the kind of person who is in the first or second group. It\xe2\x80\x99s likely that the majority of the revenue generated by the personal development industry comes from this group of people. For this group especially, the environments are absolutely critical.
Regardless of where you are in these groups, the key to stacking the odds in your favor is to get rid of everything that may take away from your mission- which takes us into the importance of environments.
If you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been to a motivational seminar or conference, you\xe2\x80\x99ve probably experienced the incredible \xe2\x80\x9chigh\xe2\x80\x9d that occurs at the end of it. You feel like you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to conquer the world and accomplish anything. You\xe2\x80\x99ve probably also noticed that a few days after the event is over the buzz wears off and everything is back to normal.
This happens because you go from being immersed in an intense uplifting environment, back to your normal environment. And your normal environment has all sorts of subconscious triggers and behaviors that are associated with it. Make no mistake- environment is stronger than willpower and when it\xe2\x80\x99s bad, whatever change you\xe2\x80\x99re hoping to make won\xe2\x80\x99t stick- the vicious personal development cycle starts all over again.
First, you have to become aware of the 9 environments that make up your life, and then design an environment that is conducive to the person you want to become. The best part is upgrading your environments doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require you to buy a McMansion and drive a Tesla- it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to cost anything.
If you\xe2\x80\x99d like to do a self-audit of your environments to understand exactly how your own 9 environments are helping or sabotaging your growth, sign up here and I\xe2\x80\x99ll send it over.
Any of the following are simple environmental upgrades that you can make at little to no cost.
Some expensive, but incredibly effective ways to upgrade your environment include moving to a different city or attending events like Jayson Gaignard\xe2\x80\x99s Mastermind Talks, where the room is filled with amazing people. Make the changes you\xe2\x80\x99re able to make now. But recognize that spending money on this stuff is like investing in your own stock- put the work in, and it\xe2\x80\x99s very profitable long term.
Each time you upgrade one environment, all the others will be impacted. The main reason that most personal development efforts fail is because most try to add in a bunch of new workouts and routines to their lives. And in the process, completely fail to take into account the impact of their environments. They really are that important.
I covered about 3 of the environments here because these three will create impacts in your life relatively quickly- but others make deeper, lasting impacts. I\xe2\x80\x99ve written about all 9 environments in another post, which you can find here.
