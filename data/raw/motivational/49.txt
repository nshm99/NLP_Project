I am obsessive.
pull the covers off my leg the same way I do every morning, with one familiar swoop that drags over my bare legs. I stand and move right foot and then left foot \xe2\x80\x94 never left foot and then right \xe2\x80\x94 toward the bathroom. When I brush my teeth, I begin at the top right molar and move up and down each tooth until arriving at my left molar. I then repeat the sequence on the bottom, this time from the left side to the right. In the shower, I grab for the bar of soap and follow a simple pattern: three long scrubs up and down my left arm, three long scrubs up and down my right, three circles on my chest, three more circles farther down, and so on. When I leave the shower, it\xe2\x80\x99s a dry towel to the head, right ear, left ear, left armpit, right armpit, grab both corners, swoop to the spine, a back-and-forth motion with enough friction to start a fire, a quick shake down both legs, and then my clothing ritual begins.
When I was very young, I had a habit of touching the edge of every counter, wall, desk, table, chair, any flat surface with the tops of my knuckles.
The sensation reassured me.
\xe2\x80\x9cMa\xe2\x80\x99am, we believe your child may have ADD, along with aspects of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 said a handful of worried doctors present in my adolescence.
the world is not as organized as you think.
We set goals without first auditing our current commitments. We visualize ourselves in a new job without studying the paths that lead there. We talk about personal changes we want to make without addressing what obstacles may prevent those changes from happening. We make promises without having tested our own commitment. We call \xe2\x80\x9cnothin\xe2\x80\x99 but net\xe2\x80\x9d on our future, our next goal, without first even bothering to ask, \xe2\x80\x9cDo I know how to shoot a basketball?\xe2\x80\x9d
The world is organized chaos, at best. I would argue chaos, proudly wearing a name tag that says:
Organization: [awr-guh-nuh-zey-shuh n]

it\xe2\x80\x99s hard. That\xe2\x80\x99s why.
It\xe2\x80\x99s hard. It\xe2\x80\x99s revealing. It\xe2\x80\x99s obvious proof that you\xe2\x80\x99re not as busy as you say you are. That you\xe2\x80\x99re not as disciplined as you thought you were. That you waste time \xe2\x80\x94 a lot of time. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you really want. You struggle with commitment. You lack perseverance and drive. You distract yourself out of fear of failure. You don\xe2\x80\x99t actually want what you say you want.
You are living a lie.
But accomplishment? Oh, everyone can talk all day about accomplishment:
\xe2\x80\x9cYou know what I want to do? What I\xe2\x80\x99m going to do? I\xe2\x80\x99m going to start a company. A big successful company \xe2\x80\x94 well, it might not even be big because who knows, maybe I want to just live on the beach and make enough to fend for myself, which wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be terrible, I\xe2\x80\x99m still thinking through the specifics. But yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to build a company \xe2\x80\x94 maybe I should wait, actually, because I have a lot going on right now and I mean what if it grows too fast? I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have to deal with too much success too early. Success like that can change people, you know. I\xe2\x80\x99m very aware of that. Yeah, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to dive in too deep just yet, because that would be a lot to handle, all that success. I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably just set a smaller goal for now. I think I want to write a book.\xe2\x80\x9d
Idiots.
Every single goal, achievement, award, finished product, deliverable, completed project, accolade, and cooked dinner requires one thing:
Time.
So, before I set a goal, any goal at all, I ask myself three things:
When I was a teenager, I wanted to become a professional World of Warcraft player.
Yes. I was.
I parted with sleep. Every single night, I pretended to go to sleep at 10pm, only to sneak back to my computer at 10:30pm to play World of Warcraft until 3am.
When I was 17 years old, I became one of the highest ranked World of Warcraft players in North America.
With this habit-focused process, I\xe2\x80\xa6
what habit can I replicate day after day after day?
If you want to be a writer, what needs to happen for you to write for 2 hours every single day?
If you can\xe2\x80\x99t answer that question, you will never become a writer.
If you want to build a successful company, what needs to happen for you to work on that startup idea for 3 hours every single day?
If you can\xe2\x80\x99t answer that question, you will never become a company founder.
If you want to become a bodybuilder, what needs to happen for you to hit the gym for 2 hours every single day, and eat a full meal every 2.5 hours, every single day?
If you can\xe2\x80\x99t answer that question, you will never become a bodybuilder.
People love to talk.
Stop talking about what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to achieve.
What I want to know is how you\xe2\x80\x99re going to make the time to practice the very thing you want to achieve.
Not just today.
How are you going to practice every single day?
And here\xe2\x80\x99s what everyone\xe2\x80\x99s response is:
\xe2\x80\x9cI just will, ok?\xe2\x80\x9d
Nah. You won\xe2\x80\x99t.
Tell me what hours. Tell me exactly what time you\xe2\x80\x99re going to sit down, and what time you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get up again.
Then tell me how you\xe2\x80\x99re going to guard that time on a daily basis.
Like I said, I\xe2\x80\x99m obsessive.
